The Domina even looks like the girl from the show which is pretty neat too. This game is an upkeep game mixed with RNG, and strategy. If you have a few hours to kill and just want something relaxing but also a quick challenge this game is worth it. Now before reading the pros and cons list I must say I loved this game, and it is def worth a couple play throughs. I just wish the endless mode was a little better to be honest.\n\nPROS:\n*The comedy in the game is great, and isn't afraid to get a little dirty.\n*Twitch integration. A simple command and the bot is in your chat, and viewers can vote event choices (although with this one your pick always wins), cheer or boo your guys to get more money after a battle, and last the decision of life or death for a gladiator that surrendered during a fight.\n*The gameplay can be quick but there is different ways to play making it a little different each time\n*Endless mode to keep the game going forever\n\nCons:\n*The game is short This is a plus for me because I don't have a lot of time to play games anymore, but for some people this is a bad thing. I will say that you WILL finish this game in about 4 hours as long as you're decent at planning, and don't pause a lot. (2 hours each run, and yes you have to play this twice unless you are crazy nice, or already know the ending)\n*Some of the game is not explained very well. For instance you get a very generic description of what the employees do. and one of the employees (I forgot the name but they look like a goat and the do sacrifices in your favor) once he is fired he can never be hired again which is not explained. and the Agent gives you negative standing with the Legate (which makes since when you think about it but just ins't explained). \n*The endless mode - I know this is something I listed as a + but at the same time it has some problems for instance you get cards to up your domina's stats but she will never be able to use these because of this game mode making them just useless and taking up spots for cards you could of gotten instead. My last play through was the first time I got domina cards and that was endless mode....which they can't be used, but I got almost no training cards! was not to happy with that. Also yes after each year the stats of the champions go up but it is so slight that it doesnt really matter.\n*Gear - you would think buying gear is a good thing but nope. really you just want to get your guys gear that is 2 or 3 levels above naked because of this - the opponents (aside from the champions which have low stats anyways) are all wearing your gear or lower they VERY rarely go higher and if they do it is like one 2 at the max. so buy gear just cost you a lot of money, and if you are only really buying on 2-3 guys then getting lower gear for the others the other man get slaughtered in fights because the opp. gear is =  to your strongest gear.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "49532287", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1552484277, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1552194686, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030755099", "playtime_forever": 939, "last_played": 1552441036, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 367}, "review": "[h1]My story from Domina.[/h1]\n\n(TLDR at bottom.)\n\nThe championship is looming, and will be here in the next few days. I have bought all the upgrades I can afford. My men are healthy, well-equipped, and highly trained. But when the day arrives, I am nervous. The enemy fighters are just as well trained, have better armor, and have two Behemoths of men on their side. Plus, there are lions in the arena. I don't know if I can win.\n\nBut it is the final fight, after a full year of blood, sweat, and preparation. There is no turning back.\n\nThe fight itself is a massive 15 vs. 15 brawl. 15 of my best men against 15 of their best (not counting lions). My gladiators enter the arena, and the match starts. Immediately, it is an absolute bloodbath. Bodies dropping, limbs flying, blood spurting, and the crowd cheering. After a short while, I realize that we have killed 9 of their fighters, but a whopping 14 of my men have died.\n\nThings do not look good. I have only one man left, and he is gravely injured. A single well-placed strike could kill him, and he is facing 6 of their men. But this one man is Dio, and Dio is my champion. He was easily the most skilled and best equipped gladiator in my entire ludus. If I had to pick a single man to be in this position, it would be Dio.\n\nSo the fight continues. Luckily, one of their men is mauled by a lion, just as Dio stabs another. It is now a 1 vs. 4. But Dio was injured again, and is down to a mere 15 health (out of his initial 700). At this point, I had given up hope. I had accepted that I would lose, and my ludus would be in financial ruin. But Dio had other plans.\n\nIn that moment, the God of War himself must have blessed Dio with all of the luck and skill in the world, because in that moment, Dio became downright invincible. This crazy mother-fucker, against 4 of the best fighters in Rome, while mortally wounded, fought his heart out. He dodged, blocked, and avoided EVERY. SINGLE. ATTACK. He proceeds to kill two men by a slide/rolling attacking, chucks a knife at a third, and lunges to finish him off. Finally, he charges forward and decapitates the fourth (and last) man. Dio has won the championship for me, while almost dead, against all odds. He has single-handedly saved my entire career. I actually jumped out of my chair in disbelief. The crowd roared. It was a glorious day.\n\nI had lost 14 men, but I didn't care. I had won the final fight, and my ludus was saved. I rewarded Dio with women and wine. It was the least I could do, since all his friends were dead. Then, I started preparing for next year's championship.\n\n\nTL;DR: Excellent game, highly underrated. Both the combat and management aspects of the game are implemented very well. The OST is also incredible. 10/10 definitely recommend.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "49473501", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1552367253, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1552076633, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167097339", "playtime_forever": 1299, "last_played": 1552155210, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 378}, "review": "You always wanted to own a gladiator and let him fight in his underpants against a lion?\nThis is your chance!\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "49440650", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1552076633, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1551757534, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065301787", "playtime_forever": 1270, "last_played": 1551757399, "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "This game is fun but there are just too many unavoidable game ending problems for me to recommend.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "49365442", "weighted_vote_score": "0.44482460618019104", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1551757534, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1551552897, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818716466", "playtime_forever": 748, "last_played": 1530188726, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "It was entertaining, but I did not like it at all.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "49320873", "weighted_vote_score": "0.369230747222900391", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1551552897, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"timestamp_created": 1551233892, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998304796", "playtime_forever": 612, "last_played": 1530323108, "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius Decimus Maximus Meridius Decimus Meridius Maximus...", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "49255561", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1551233892, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 4}, {"timestamp_created": 1551016141, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013073925", "playtime_forever": 1486, "last_played": 1552832749, "num_reviews": 58, "num_games_owned": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 271}, "review": "Got this one in a bundle , it's very enjoyable though. You have to manage various resources in order to get to the top , winning as many arena fight as you can. Those resources are gold ,water,wine,food , employees , political people's favor and ofcourse , gladiators /slaves xD. You have to train your gladiators,upgrade their gear, hire employees that bring bonuses and upgrades to your ludus(gladiator school ,in this case). From time to time , you also get pop-ups with decisions to make that might affect your game in the future. You can take control of a gladiator and play as him in the arena, or let the A.I. do all the job. We also have different gladiator types : dual swords, sword and shield , trident and net. \n\nThe artwork is nice, retro in a way. The soundtrack is awesome ,one of the best i have heard lately. The only downside is that the songs repeat themselves too often. By the date this review was written , this game was still getting support and updates , so that's also a plus.

Many of these you can hire or buy directly to help grow your empire (produce resources to nurture and improve stat levelling for your gladiators). In between combat you are ensuring the stable of fighters are well armed, well trained, etc. This plays out like a resource and RPG style game. It's very relaxing and interspersed will be story elements that develop your relationship with other individuals in the city.

[/h1]\n\n[i] Domina is a game by DolphinBarn, an upcoming indie developer. This is the second game they\u2019ve made and has become even more successful than the last one. In Domina, you, a female commander of gladiators, will have to recruit more gladiators. Paying for their equipment and food to eventually win the national championship.  The question is: is the path to that championship actually worth it?[/i]\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n\u2705 \tClean and vibrant graphics style conveys what\u2019s happening but doesn\u2019t make it unnecessarily complicated.\n\u2705\tEven with quite a lot of menu\u2019s it never feels like a chore and they\u2019re clear and easy to use\n\u2705\tability to control your own gladiators introduces skills which add a lot more depth to the game.\n\u2705\tWith other Roman officials to keep happy you open up a lot more possibilities in the gladiator world\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n\u274c\tlimited customization with gladiators as all the final gear looks the same per class and    cannot be modified in colour \n        in any way\n\u274c\tMultiple play throughs will very often go the same way \n\nDomina is a relatively historical 8-bit experience of what it took to become a female master of gladiators: A Domina! Although Domina itself translates as \u2018master of the house\u2019 so it\u2019s not a term used specifically for this type of character but it fits the game wonderfully. Your goal is to train as many strong and brave gladiators to fight in the final battle against another group. You have 1 year to accomplish this going from nothing to a well-established gladiator master.\n\n[u] Management? I just want to kill some bros[/u]\n\nNo one ever said that being a gladiator master didn\u2019t require any paperwork! You have to provide food and water for your gladiators and any other servants you have. You must build upgrades and hire employees to make everything run ever more smoothly and bribe powerful figures. This all sounds quite complicated but it\u2019s actually done really stylishly! The menu navigation is  easy and I never felt like I anything was hidden that was possible to do; although at first it took me a while to figure out that to hire new employees it was in the market menu however that could be a problem that lay with me not the game. \n\nAnother big plus is that equipment for your gladiators can be bought in the menu of a specific gladiator instead of in a long unclear menu where you\u2019re buying equipment and you can\u2019t remember who it was for or what it was called; I really liked that. Something I\u2019m not so fond of is that when you go to upgrade a weapon or a piece of gear both your options are highlighted in green if you can afford them or one in red if you cannot afford it. The thing I find most annoying is that the downgrading option which is getting a cheaper piece of equipment is always in green which has confused me at times when I was quickly changing armor. I would like to have it switched to a plain colour as it\u2019s always going to be available as you\u2019re only gaining money doing such an action.\n\n[u] I\u2019ll take my revenge! I mean, Claudius will [/u]\n\nAfter a couple of research options you can control your own gladiators, instead of them being A.I. controlled, to control their own lunges, dodges and blocks. This is actually done really well, you can see the skills you invested in earlier actually shown with increased combat ability as they\u2019re not 1% or 2% changes. Combat feels very fair; even if my gladiator has 100 less health I can still win if I keep dodging and striking him from behind. All your enemies are always balanced to your own level of gladiators .So if you invest all your money into one gladiator all opposing gladiators will also be that powerful thus it subconsciously forces you to even out your earnings. I think this approach is way better than a standard levelling curve as even if you were to cheat by adding extra money it would really make no difference to the actual skill you need to win duels. \n\n[u] Historical accuracy [/u]\n\nOf course this game relies heavily on history, in fact the sole reason that this game exists is probably because of the fact that this history exists. When it comes to historical accuracy of course you can only turn so much into a game before it becomes boring to play. A clear example of this is the fact that very often Roman gladiators didn\u2019t die at all, keep in mind that a gladiator is quite expensive and you don\u2019t want them dying all the time as the funding per fight wasn\u2019t that gigantic. However the developers of this game know that if no one would ever die then: what\u2019s the fun? So I don\u2019t blame them for keeping that out. \n\nBesides that a lot of things have been done right, a gladiator training center was really called a ludus and real historical gladiator classes have actually been recreated in game; although there is a thing I don\u2019t like about it which I\u2019ll get to later. I think the crowds and other characters have been recreated nicely wearing genuinely realistic Roman clothing and I can really only say good things about the historical accuracy which I think deserves some praise as often arcade style games only use it as inspiration. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t like is that all the different types of gladiators have been put into 3 very distinct classes. In real life the variations would\u2019ve varied more, even in the same class of gladiator. While I understand that it\u2019s quite a hassle to get everything in there, I do find it a downside and ties in with my point about a lack of customization at higher levels of gear. \n\n[u] Technicals [/u]\n\nPerformance wise I had no issue running this and neither should you, my older computer containing a GT620 was easily able to run this game as the total screen only contains about 200 pixels. (i5-7600K,1050TI 4GB OC, 8GB Ram, HDD 7200rpm) I did have an issue where I could not get it to run in fullscreen as it would move across to my secondary display. I found no way to change this back to the primary display, this might\u2019ve just been Windows 10, but having it just full-sized on my main display was fine playing as well since it\u2019s a 2D game. \n\n[u] Summary [/u]\n\nDomina, while not perfect is still incredibly fun and I\u2019ve had a blast playing it. Since playthroughs are short it\u2019s the kind of game you play when you don\u2019t know what to play. Even with its apparent lack of content I think it will keep its replayability, because even though reruns are the same per run it\u2019s still very fun even if it stays relatively the same. If the devs open up mod support at one point it will thrive harder than ever.\n\n[b] Score: 89/100 [/b]\n\nThis game was provided for free by the developers, however my opinion has not been influenced by it.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/23741321/]Follow our curator page,[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "comment_count": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "48387837", "weighted_vote_score": "0.711869597434997559", "votes_up": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1547750103, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1547664078, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131926932", "playtime_forever": 335, "last_played": 1549502145, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "great game, great soundtrack", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "48370054", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1547664078, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1547607906, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025518519", "playtime_forever": 880, "last_played": 1548005128, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I bought this game shortly after it was released and playing it now? what the hell has happened to this?\n\nit's literally impossible to keep the Legate and Magistrate happy now, and if both of them are unhappy they give you fights that are nearly impossible for your gladiators to win.\n\nI've also noticed the training speed has gone down significantly which makes this game that much harder to get progress, really not enjoying the updates the devs have been adding because its just slowing down the games progress.\n\nReally hope this game doesn't continue to go in the direction it goes it.

It's a fun game, short and sweet and to the point. There are some frustrating bits, but the game isn't too punishing as far as I've experienced and overall makes for a decent game you can play through in one sitting, with the intent being to play it a couple times.\n\nI personally love gladiator games, so this was right up my alley.  The fact that it\u2019s bloody, short, and very replayable (more so with an endless mode) means that it was worth the $10 I paid for it. I will warn you though, you will not be able to beat the game on your first time. There\u2019s going to be a moment in the end game that\u2019s going to be frustrating, but it\u2019s not that bad beyond making you upset in the moment. Game sessions here last only a few hours so it\u2019s alright to make mistakes every now and then and get screwed by the game. It\u2019s part of the experience since after all, nobody said ancient Rome was a pleasant place.\n\nUltimately, I must recommend this game based on the quality of the gameplay I experienced. It was fun for me and I enjoyed playing through a couple runs, and there's a lot of content to be happy about, from controlling your gladiators physically in battle to an endless mode that offers a good amount of replayability. The game can be frustrating sometimes, and the story can come across as too preachy and with an agenda, but it\u2019s easy to ignore these things once you\u2019re gibbing other people\u2019s gladiators with your champions. \n\nVerdict: 7/10.

However it focus far to much on the blood and gore part of gladiatorial combat, which make this game historical inaccurate. \nIt was rare that a gladiator would die in the arena, and when that did occur, the owner of the dead gladiator would be compensited. Gladiators also had access to the best \"healthcare\" in the empire, equal to the quality of emperores.\nThis focus makes the game unbalenced too. Since you regularly have to sacrifice your expansive gladiators in the arena in matches you have no control over. \nIt feels more like a gambling or betting game, than a game of calculated risk.\n\nHowever I have too admit that the fight scenes looks cool, even with the retro-graphics.

And add a calander instead of a \"clock-timer\" that just count down to the next match.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "48129349", "weighted_vote_score": "0.570440769195556641", "votes_up": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1546716617, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1546705864, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070827495", "playtime_forever": 792, "last_played": 1546708716, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Definitely a game worth buying especially at such a low price, but the use of random events is appaling! Several times ive built an awesome team of several top tier gladiators for the game to randomly have me ambushed outside of the ludus and then killed in a fight i cant possibly win, and to top it off, in my dominas absence from the ludus all of my gladiators escaped and all my resources were stolen... Whats the point of such a broken game mechanic, you may aswell have the plague roll through and just kill everyone of my gladiators. There is no warning or sense to any of this, and thats before mentioning the countless random events where some rich or crazy person forces my best gladiator to fight to the death and i almost always (9/10 times) lose. \n\nThe game has huge promise, especially if you like micro managing, and this time period, but the vast majority of the game is too simplistic for multiple run throughs, mechanics arent fully explained, and some are just game breaking, if they were to do this with the depth of one of the tycoon genre gmaes then id happily pay 5x what i did for it, but for now its good to kill a few hours but then theres little to no point returning to it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "48125294", "weighted_vote_score": "0.566474020481109619", "votes_up": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1546705864, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1546700722, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126200334", "playtime_forever": 3788, "last_played": 1551749963, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "First let me preface this review saying that I like resource and people management games with survival/action elements. If you need proof, look at how many hours I\u2019ve logged in Rimworld. This game is designed beautifully, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. The management aspects of this game are challenging, but not unfair. I bought this game at the same time as my BF, and we both loved it at first. No spoilers, but there is a twist at the very end of the game that made him so mad he stopped playing it. But for me this twist has kept me interested. It\u2019s trying to find that balance that has kept me coming back for game after game. \n\nGameplay is about 2-3 hours for the standard mode as long as you don\u2019t spend too much time paused. I'm currently on my fourth year in Endless mode with a maxed Ludus and maxed gear gladiators. \n\nBut just to state it again I love this game and think its great. The developer did very well, and I can\u2019t wait to check out any more work they do. \n\nAs for changes I would like to see:\n-If you have very high to maxed happiness with the Legate and Magistrate, it will stop the random event \"crazy general challenges your best man\" battles, which almost always kill off your best gladiator in the standard mode. I even build a private quarters for my best gladiator and house him in it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to decrease the likelihood of the event despite what the description says. I\u2019ll still get it 3-5 times per game. \n-Larger map with more verities of battle, from low level to very high (Endless mode geared) battles. i know in the current map there isn\u2019t much more room, but you could fold it into the story that you are trying to not only gain fame in Rome, but in all the lands it has conquered to really make yourself stand out to the Emperor. \n- Possibly introduce a way to have other people sponsor a gladiator. Maybe make it a percent chance after you have a match that the crowd really likes.\n- More impact with Magistrate and Legate Happiness in general. I feel like other than getting a little more gold in matches, that there seems to be very little impact on the game for the effort of keeping them in \u201cBlissful\u201d. The gladiators and slaves still seem just as expensive. They are still just as likely to give you an unfair match, especially towards the end of the game. \n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "48123367", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1546700722, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1546666086, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000482770", "playtime_forever": 1340, "last_played": 1550339034, "num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "good", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "48113499", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1546666086, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1546651802, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117742357", "playtime_forever": 1593, "last_played": 1546724450, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Excellent game", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "48110013", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1546651802, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1546651452, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970687387", "playtime_forever": 674, "last_played": 1546568944, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I watched as my best gladitor got 2 shoted by a gladiator twice his size, which started the collapse of my ludus, 10/10 would do it again", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "48109933", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1546651452, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1546631273, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297273774", "playtime_forever": 4081, "last_played": 1547666341, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I don't usually write reviews, but here we are, writing a review! The game is pretty minimalistic and fun. The fights are fast paced, the progress? It takes quite a chunk of time to advance and understand the game.Domina is pretty difficult to play, since you will have to manage the resources and training for your gladiators. Not to mention that you will have to win the favor of the Legate and the Senate. Not doing so, will result in harder fights for your gladiators, which will eventually lead them to their death. This isn't a game that you can master in just a day, although once you understand, the fun begins. I wouldn't call the game \"difficult\" but rather challenging. In this game, you will compete for Gladiator Championship of Rome. You will be assigned three(3) gladiators at the begining of the game, each one of them, wearing their equipment. Their equipment varies as much as their stats: Every gladiator has different stats(see for yourself). You're not sure if you really want the game? Here are a few reason why you shoul buy it:\n \n[list]\n    [*]Fun! \n    [*]Lots and lots of hours to spend\n    [*]Entertaining. Whether you will control one of your own gladiators, or let them fight by themselves(AI) all outcomes are definitely interesting. \n    [*] Great time killer! - I spent quite a few hours with this game, and I can only tell you that it was worth it! It can be frustrating to loose a gladiator - do not get dragged away by that. If you will get to understand the game, it will become somewhat easier to win the fights.\n[/list]\n\nOverall impression: I can only recommend this game. It is worth every penny.

As a Ludo mistress you need to manage all affairs of a Ludo: from the slave purchase, training and equiping to upgrading your Ludo and staff. At the same time you have to tend to your politic status by keeping \"good\" relations with the influent people, so you dont get (too) screwed... Additionally, if you are a action junkie, you will eventually get to control a gladiator on the arena. Very \"Streets of Rage\" style!\n\nSHORT EVAL:\n-The learning curve is steep. Very easy to learn, not hard to master, but keeps the player alive providing constant challenge.\n-Graphics are... well, pixels, and very old-school ones at that!... But the game's style and art make it weirdly good-looking! \n-Also, pixel style fits perfectly on all the arena gore and \"RomanEmpirey\" look and feel.\n-The Sound on this game...is AWESOME! Probably the best thing. The soundtrack couldnt be more intune with the game and the soundFX really add up to the game's environment.\n\nThere's a lot of  fun, adrenaline and gore packed in this easy-to-play game. A good deal!\n8/10\n\nTHE FEEL (long and extended... i'm bored)!\nThe management part of the game is pretty simple and easy to master but it's fun nontheless! Decision-making is so fast-paced! Every decision you make is meaningful, it will have effects almost immediatelly and game mechanics make sure to keep you constantly \"off-balance\" and on the verge of doom, so you wont have those waitingForSomethingToHappen-moments. It's like driving on a straingh road in a car that doesnt drive straight! Turn, turn, TURN!!! x)\nOn one hand it adds a little addrenaline to management. On the other hand, there wont be much pleasure from planning and executing. There is no planning, only executing! Instinctive management! :P I love it!\nThen there's the arena fights! So much pace, so much gore, so much intensity!... Sending your \"champion\" to the arena against tremendous odds. The fight starts, opponents rush to your champion. He takes hits, but he lands some good ones too. The crowd goes wild as the blood pours from each blow! One after another your champion's opponents fall. Legs, arms and heads fly all over the red sand and finally, from all the mess, your gadiator emerges victorious!!! The crowd is extatic! You go back to the ludo, with your gladiator, the price and the spoils. All of this in like.... 6 seconds! What a rush!\nThere is no story line to follow but there is a twist at the end of the game that will put of your choices on perspective. So even then the game surprises you.\nI could NOT end this without telling again about the soundtrack! By artist \"BIGNIC\". Powerfull, somewhat epic, modern but perfectly fitting the theme.

The crowd jeering crudely in the background of fights sets the scenes nicely. \"F**k off back to Thrace!\"\n\nPixel style visuals are amazing. Combat is extremely fast paced and brutal. It isn't static - characters roll and move whilst fighting in a fluid manner with brilliant animations. Loved watching limbs hacked and heads cleaved right off with an explosion pixel gore and blood to follow.\n\nTwitch integration sounds like an interesting feature - generating gladiator names from your linked Twitch channel. (However I cannot give feedback regarding this as I have not tried it.)\n\nA negative that I can list is that the gladiator skills/attributes now have a cap to their values - I played before this was implemented and the results were hilarious. Gladiators became gods - being able to kill multiple opponents with one attack, or move around the arena at ridiculous speeds. I am a little disappointed that it was fixed.\n\nHowever, I can still highly recommend this.

He continued to win every single battle, no matter how strong or how numerous the enemy were. He was my greatest gladiator. His name would be known throughout the lands. But all of a sudden, a strange man clad in dark armour approached me in my palace, asking to fight to the death with my strongest man: the almighty Biggus Dickus. His presence gripped my heart with fear; I simply couldn't decline. Promptly, I sent my prize champion to fight with this stranger. The gates opened, the contestants moved onto the arena. The battle began. To my shock, Biggus Dickus was pounced upon by the stranger, and struck down in two swift blows. All the memories I shared with this gladiator, all the times I helped him train, celebrated with him, helped him through hardships, were lost to the sharp steel of this menace's blade, almost as though Biggus Dickus was nothing to him.

Also you choose the difficulty so maybe beat the game once or twice on an average level then really make the game punish you. The fun of this game comes from replaying it at harder difficultes, once you beat the game once the challenge is the same but the random events will change up a bit. \n\nI got my 30 hours out of it because I wanted to 100% the game.

Its a management/simulation at heart, Gladiators can be directly controlled but it doesnt work well, youll mostly be watching auto-matches.\n\n RNG is sporadic, and the various stats on fighters are not balanced well, so fight outcomes can be unpredictable. Since youll likely lose your plebs from defeat in combat, losing matches to random variables can be infuriating. Even more so when its one of your veterans youve spent countless time and money investing in.\n\nEvery week there is an Arena fight, you need to win to earn money to buy food and resources with. Domina struggles to find balance in its difficulty, matches are randomized RNG and the only two possibilities Ive ever seen are ridiculously difficult rigged matches, and ridiculously easy ones. You are forced to either fight the randomized match, or refuse (with additional penalties) and you wont be able to get another re-roll for a different match until a week later. This can be problematic if your broke or out of food and NEED to win, but RNG screws you with a rigged match roll youd never possibly win.\n\nItll have you go 1 v 3 with AI advantage, or 2 v 1 against AI fighter whos chained to the floor, rarely are there fair or reasonable odds. It can also be difficult to gauge the difficulty of a match before you accept it due to limited information on opponent gladiators and the game not ever bothering to explain how its systems work.\n\nIm not sure if there is an \"end game\" but the farthest I got was starting to enter into the games elite Tournaments. Sadly, these are obscenely difficult, rigged matches of course, but against OP enemies who will wipe out anyone you send in within seconds.\n\nEven simply watching the auto-fights with your gladiators can be exhilarating. There is a lot on the line, and some matches can be won or lost by a hair. Its a great feeling to win a difficult match underequipped, and be pulled from the brink of bankruptcy. But conversely its defeating and infuriating to lose an easy fight to RNG shenanigans and go bankrupt because you didnt win the purse.\n\nRepetition set in fairly quickly for me. After about an hour of playtime I started to grow tired of the poor RNG mechanics. Its addicting though, easy to get into but difficult to master. The art direction is superb, the little pixel gladiators are adorable and fights are a spectacle.\n\n7/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "46529840", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1542959005, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1542953241, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239753478", "playtime_forever": 449, "last_played": 1542953256, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Love the soundtrack", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "46520018", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1542953241, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1542949129, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013459771", "playtime_forever": 1203, "last_played": 1551932101, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50}, "review": "Overall really impressed by this developer.

Domina takes the brutality of gladiatorial combat and gives it an addictive layer.\n\nDomina with its visceral and gritty portrayal envoked a hard to admit instinct-driven sadistic side of my gaming fixations, instilling a certain kind of excitement for the sport of blood that sits macabrely at the root of humanity and its violent history. The feeling is just so intensely real despite its low-fi visual style, mostly lent to by the gruff and mature handling of situations and dialogue. Lines that don't hold back on the adult language or the mature situations made Domina feel like something right out of a Frank Miller graphic novel.\n\nThe heavy and pulsing soundtrack driving the banquet of blood and evisceration, the gore and the disregard for life in favor of entertainment and profit, Domina makes a strong argument for the case that maybe humanity's history has only ever been capable of death and destruction from the beginning. The same high-energy and infectiously melodic electronic jams you would expect from bignic are here in full force now with arabesque horns and strings wonderfully winding their way into the mix for a heavy and esoteric sound befitting of its period.\n\nAll in all, if you admire the brutality of combat sports, or dig the history behind gladiatorial colloseums, or you're just a big bloodthirsty freak who wants to spill more blood for the Blood Gods, Dominic is your bloodsport simulator for sure.", "comment_count": 4, "received_for_free": true, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "45919012", "weighted_vote_score": "0.723108172416687012", "votes_up": 27, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1542747346, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"timestamp_created": 1542735962, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089736158", "playtime_forever": 1063, "last_played": 1543439231, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Really charming gladiator management game right here. probably the best in this unexplored genre. it has its flaws, like for example it gets repetetive after a couple in game years pass. and when you get a top gladiator, basically he'll never die. but all in all, i loved it. 8/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "45916851", "weighted_vote_score": "0.568832755088806152", "votes_up": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1542735962, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1542543964, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063456617", "playtime_forever": 931, "last_played": 1502842459, "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "The flood of positive reviews for this game aren't exaggerated - this game allows for both hands-on control if you want an arcade-y fighting game, and a hand-off simiulator as you balance resources whilst training up your squad of unbeatable gladiators; the latter being particularly nail-biting as you get to watch the match as a spectator.\n\nOn top of all that - honestly one of the best soundtracks in gaming; blisteringly good tunes on this.

Just when I was very frustrated and decided to uninstall the game I realized I don't have to fight every arena battle. That was the moment I started to enjoy and couldn't stop playing it!\n\nThe game has a very good random story engine and everytime you play, you have another scenerio. Most of these games end pretty bad, I'll be honest. However, it's that special era of Rome where you can get screwed anytime, anywhere. If you watched Spartacus series you know what I'm talking about. \n\nI literally shed tears when my oldest gladiator \"Spartan Brutus\" died because of General or Rome ordered an execution fight; Brutus against 10 gladiators. He fought braverly, killing 7 of them but couldn't take it anymore... When my dear Brutus' head was rolling on the bloody sands I realized my Ludus won't be the same again. After that everything went downwards and I lost my most valuable gladiators one by one. And one day I found myself in the middele of the arena with a single dagger in my hand; being executed violently because I was found guilty of trachery. That moment I realized it was wrong to accuse the General of Rome with adultry when I saw him at the brother... Damn my dignity, damn my greed. I was so stupid... \n\nBe ready, it might need more than a couple tries to end the game as you wanted!\n\nWhat are the things awesome in this game?\n- Really beautiful pixel art! I'm not a fan of pixel art and I'm really picky about visuals but this is one of the few games I really loved for its visuals. Fighting animations are wonderful, gladiator reactions to attacks are realistic and the fighting pace is just perfect!\n- Simple but very satisfying management. You don't feel yourself pushed for micro management but it's still challenging.\n- Emotional connection with your gladiators makes it hard to decide whom should \"die\"\n- Intrigues and random events make it possible to play the game over and over. Random events can be both punishing and rewarding. Also early decision makin can change the random events later on. Great play!\n- Randomly losing game actually a good thing about this game. It makes you motivates you to succeed next time.\n\nWhat could be better?\n- Amounts of random events could be higher. After playing the game like... 30 times you start to know what to do and what to avoid.\n- Game can be too punishing without any reason sometimes. \"Life sucks\" mentality can be frustrating.\n- Mind Control is way too OP especially when you learn the AI reactions. I was playing with a single gladiator myself through the end of the game since I could kill even much stronger opponents by myself. Well, then there were 7 gladiators fcked me really hard... But still, this skill should be nerfed.\n- Recruits to hire are not that much useful. They could be designed better to improve Ludus or gladiators.\n- Gladiator balance is not well set. Shield and Spear is far stronger than anything else.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "45171818", "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1538991380, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1538986273, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009711121", "playtime_forever": 1381, "last_played": 1539058651, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Buy it for the soundtrack alone!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "45171027", "weighted_vote_score": "0.561461746692657471", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1538986273, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1538916547, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012106307", "playtime_forever": 1172, "last_played": 1539001280, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Good game", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "45157093", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1538916547, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1538820643, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023657926", "playtime_forever": 1061, "last_played": 1540384764, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": ".", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "45134751", "weighted_vote_score": "0.320538371801376343", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1538820643, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1538721636, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040557808", "playtime_forever": 3744, "last_played": 1538988207, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "This game has developed very well since it's earlier release and is well worth the price of admission- if you're into the kind of game this is.  If you like the sort of game that hits you in the mouth and challenges you a bit this is for you.  Sitting on a shelf beside the likes of Darkest Dungeon and Battle Brothers this type of of game has an ebb and flow you can master, but heavy random elements to force the player to react and adapt their mastered playstyle to succeed.\n\nYou're the owner of a school that trains gladiators in the falling days of the Roman Empire.  With one full year announced until the big championship in Rome you set out to make a name for your ludas and gain both the adoration of the crowd and admission to the games by winning three required regional championships before the year ends.\n\nGameplay revovles around training these gladiators and fighting them in the arena.  The game allows a \"mind control\" upgrade that has you personally control your gladiator, but seems best suited for allowing the player to take a passenger seat during the events and allowing the AI to fight based on the stats of the combatant.  \n\nAlong with the purchasing of slaves to train as gladiators you also hire employees to oversee more upgrade-oriented aspects of the ludas. The game boasts a fairly large upgrade gold-sink system that has you always needing more and requiring you to strategically use what's available to you.  Slots for available employees are limited, so your overall ludas begins to develop a \"build\" along with each individual gladiator.  \n\nDomina plays in what is generally referred to as a \"rogue-like\" or \"ironman\" system that has the game auto-saving as often as possible to force the player to stick with the outcomes. \n\nI generally only write reviews for games that I would recommend and Domina falls into that category.

Decisions have to be made with care and foresight, or you might quickly find yourself without gladiators, starved out, dehydrated and sorely lacking in wine. One of the great things is that no matter how harsh a blow you're dealt, if you're smart about it, there's almost always a way to recover. This makes the decision-making very satisfying.\n\nAlso, the extensive support from the game's dev should be commended. When Domina was first released and it seemed to suffer from massive issues, I was doubtful and it took quite a while until I eventually picked the game up. There may still be some minor bugs hidden in the crevices that go mostly unnoticed, but even a year later, the dev not only works hard to squash them all out, but also adds new content and features that enrich the existing gameplay.

I found the pixel art to be enjoyeable but not everyone may think that. This game does allow you to take control of one of your gladiators if you so wish, but it's not necessary. You can just sit back and watch your gladiators climb to victory or fall in defeat.\n\nYou will need to realize that eventually most of your gladiators will die. So you're always churning your roster. Nothing is sadder than upgrading your gladiator, given him the best chance of success, only to watch him fall in battle when you bit off more than you could chew.\n\nThis game is punishing for mistakes that way. So it definitely does pay off to think in advance and to read a little about best strategies before mindlessly going into battle. I paid $3.39 USD in the steam summer sale and it's a great deal.

I wouldn't say its mindless fun, because often times you sit wondering about the best strategy to increasing a gladiators stats and the moral dilemmas that keep popping up keep you on your toes. The chariot sessions are a bit boring, but the fighting is never dull or predictable. Loosing your best fighter to something as mundane as suicide, escape or a death match by someone trying to prove themselves makes things interesting.

Also, I played full playthroughs of the game without the \"Mind Control\" trait, which allows you to play one gladiator yourself, so it really is possible to play this game with just a management job.\n\nGives you around 10-20 hours of fun if you have other games that you want to play, but for me it will surely have alot more value cause of me trying to get the achievements, which basically require you to play the game alot, but that is fine, it's nothing you should sit down for hours in one session but play small portions.\n\n[spoiler] A helpful little thing to remember: Always do pitfights and don't shy away from the regional champions, they are pretty easy if you have a gladiator above level 100, you don't need Superman to slay these Behemoths. Also, make sure to fully upgrade your chariot and horse before entering a chariot race, they can get really messy.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall I enjoyed and still enjoy the game alot despite its nearly dysfunctional battle system, which is kinda said as it is the main portion of the game.

You just cannot help cheering when your Gladiators crush the opponent! Every time my gladiators fought in the Colosseum I turned up the music and found myself clapping, cheering and shouting random things like \"Slaughter them!\". I cheer them on while I watch those little pixel guys chop off heads and arms. A bit brutal, but its pixels... so what's the real harm, right? :D\n\nThis game is simply amazing. With beautiful pixel art that lets my imagination run wild. You run your own Ludus and you have the power. You can set your little gladiators free, put them to death or make them fight in an ancient arena. There are Lions,  chariot races, bloody fights and other awesome stuff.\n\nIt's impressive how a pixel game like this can really induce various emotions. You'll have favorites which you will dress up in the most expensive armor and reward with wine and coin. While you will discard others easily if they are too flawed. \n\nI would also like to add that the developer is awesome! He listens, debugs and is constantly active updating and improving the game. I had a problem with posting the twitter animations of my battles and after a bit of correspondence he found the bug and fixed it. Now I can tweet all my victories and show off my gladiator stock. \n\nThe game is very elaborate. You have to train and upgrade your Gladiators, pick skills from a skill tree and you can hire up to 3 employees who give you various perks, some we're overpowered but I'm sure they will get an update sometime. . You have to keep both the Magistrate and Legate happy and keep your resources stocked up.\n\nI ended up playing Domina hours on end, the Saturday came and went.

The same stupid shit music you'd expect in a Roman-era themed piece of media - then the mother of all bass drops. Let me tell you, I've never been so awstruck at a soundtrack. Risk of Rain and Deadbolt might have good soundtracks, but they're just chill soundtracks. This is a soundtrack that's intense and brutal, what this game is all about. (and honestly the type of music I've been longing for)\n\nIt gets even more intense when my first fight I get into has that same soundtrack drop right as the battle starts. I've never wanted to scream more in my life as my slave started beating down the other slave.\n\nSo that's the frist 10 mintues of my gameplay, and I already love the $3 I spent on this.\n\n\n\nFor full price, yeah sure if you're into brutal fights. It's not movie-style fights. You get into a fight, you get hit three times, you're dead. Or vice versa, people are easy to kill and this game reflects that. It's brutal and intense. There's an option to dull weapons too, if you don't like realistic weapons quick deaths and all that. \n\nYou have the ~option~ to play as a character, but you first have to unlock it through research (it only takes two fights before you'll get the research) and even then the combat isn't very good so it's best to level up into the automatic AI than bother playing yourself. \n\nSo if you're looking for anything more than a quick intense game of watching blood and battle then you're not at the right place. Bit odd the combat isn't good for a gladiator game huh? I don't view this as a gladiator game, it's a [u]gladiator management[/u] game. You watch the fights, you watch as everything you've worked for evaporates into blood before your eyes or everything you've worked for drinks the souls of your oppositions fate. It's not boring, let me tell you.\n\n\n\nAs for buying the soundtrack?

They seriously speed up training.\n- Be careful with the fight pit, it is very random and you could end up losing your most prized gladiator\n- With the random event of the decorated war hero, make sure you have this set to player controlled, not AI, or you will get mashed!\n- I found constantly holding the shield, letting the enemy attack, then striking at them an extremely effective way of winning in combat, similar to dark souls combat\n- ALWAYS do the gladiator exhibition for both the Legate and the Magistrate, these will give all your gladiators experience that participated in the event.

So there wasn't any difficulty anymore and the game got itself very repetitive: upgrade gladiators with the money earnt from last fights; fight; repeat; add the occasional click to start a new research; done.\n\nAnd the final fight will give you the middle finger if you didn't know how to prepare for it.\nSolution : [spoiler]You need to train 2 super-human shielded dudes and free 1 before the last fight (possibly with some other lower ranked gladiators), as after the final fight, you'll be sentenced to execution in the arena and only be helped by all the slaves & gladiators you had freed during your run[/spoiler].\n\nOh, and I almost forgot: the fighting engine is bugged so prepare yourself to see swording gladiators hitting nothing for 3 minutes in a row before seeing the \"Lost\" announce.\n\n[h1]=== Pros ===[/h1]\n- Great atmosphere and very engaging at the start\n- The pressure of the 1st few fights\n\n[h1]=== Cons ===[/h1]\n- Gearing up is ultra basic and straightforward with way too many stuff that doesn't bring anything gameplay wise\n- Quickly, you'll get 1 or 2 super-human gladiators who 1-hit everything, and you won't be able to train other gladiators due to the leveling & matchmaking system which don't give you enough choice\n- Visually, it's a mess and equipment is barely recognizable; a 3D version would be marvelous\n- There's basically no meaningful management, as everything is super simple and straightforward\n- Horribly bugged fighting engine, making only the shielded gladiator viable, while the 2 other styles are nearly useless (check the updates, maybe the Dev fixed that lately)\n- The fighting engine doesn't create fights enjoyable to watch: it's just a dumb frenzy ending after 3 or 4 strikes\n- Overall, no gameplay depth and thus no meaningful replayability except if you're drawn into the game atmosphere", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "42894239", "weighted_vote_score": "0.526486694812774658", "votes_up": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1529564600, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1529557852, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118863545", "playtime_forever": 332, "last_played": 1521778125, "num_reviews": 94, "num_games_owned": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "this game made me know im sadistic", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "42892521", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1529557852, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1529506113, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999168800", "playtime_forever": 1279, "last_played": 1529533240, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Good game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "42876983", "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1529506113, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1529460074, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073626572", "playtime_forever": 334, "last_played": 1525318113, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "A good way to kill 5 hours and your passion for living.

Art style is solid, good variety in upgrades, and a sweet soundtrack.  \n\nUnfortunately, the game lacks in a lot of things, and it's really too bad.  If I knew anything about game design I would totally be on board with developing a game like Domina, but with much different choices in gameplay design.  The battles are painfully fast.... the whole point of gladiatorial matches was to put on a grand show, yet most fights end in 3 seconds... even with a 8v8 match, it can be over in the blink of an eye.  There's no sense of tension, like having 4 guys methodically inch towards your last surviving fighter with chained tigers at your back.  I want to play a gladiator game for the cinematic spectacle, but instead it plays like a robochef meat grinder set to maximum speed.  The whole pace of the game is way too fast to really immerse yourself in becoming a Lanista and building a connection to the Ludus.  \n\nAlso, difficulty is an issue.  I get it, 8-bit games have this strange \"obligation\" to be hard, but it's just not fun.  This coming from someone who is no stranger to playing games on the highest difficulty.  This isn't the \"fun\" type of difficulty, mostly coming down to the breakneck speed of the fights.

[/i]\n\nI got this game as part of a bundle, so bear that in mind (I think I paid about $10 for the whole bundle, and it came with a number of games including Domina).\n\nThe play time I have is from beating the game twice.\n\nI'm giving this one a thumbs up. Overall I'd give Domina a 7 / 10. It was solid fun, and I could see myself coming back and beating it again for some mindless fun down the road. \n\nYou play as Domina of a Ludus, which basically means you are the boss of a place where gladiators are kept, fed, equipped and trained, and you are responsible for guiding their training and their career. All gladiators within the ludus are slaves, explaining your full control over them. Fights occur on a timer, set up by two NPCs (the Legate and the Magistrate) who you can vie for support with. This seemed like a cool element, but was really hollow in practice. You can also attend pit fights through the marketplace, but the 'details are hazy' so its more of a risk. There is a lot of randomization here, but generally the fights get harder as the game progresses, so you better keep at least a couple good gladiators alive or you'll be in trouble. While the early fights of the game can sometimes have surprising outcomes, with an underdog emerging on top, later on some gladiators will simply annihilate others no matter what. \n\nThe game has lots of RPG elements, with each gladiator having their own stats and levels, which increase through training and combat. You also research a tech tree, and can recruit up to three employees from a decent list, each of whom have unique benefits. One gripe I have is that some employees are just explicitly better or worse than others, kind of forcing your hand in the end. Not having the blacksmith character (can't recall its latin name) is a terrible idea, so one of your slots is basically taken up automatically by him. \n\nOne of the early researches allows you to 'mind control' a gladiator, taking manual control, but honestly the AI were way better than I was so I never used that utility. Cool idea, but the pacing of the game was one where a computer kinda had me beat at least. This means that the AI control stat for each gladiator is incredibly important, and always the first one you want to level. This is not encouraged by the game by default, as it sets the training for it to 0 with all new gladiators. Little things like that where Domina doesn't help you a lot to learn, or actively points you in the wrong direction in some ways, are part of why I gave only a good score as opposed to a great one.\n\nSpeaking of combat, I would recommend to enable \"Brutal Combat\" in the options. It makes the fights actually last any duration, where without it many fights lasted literally less than a second. Brutal combat lessens all damage done, allowing for more intrigue in a match, and giving lesser champions at least a fighting chance.\n\nThis review is already getting long, so this'll be the last thing about content that I mention. The goal of the game is to defeat at least three regional champions through a seperate map, to qualify for the Grand Championship that happens after one year. One small gripe I had was that the regional champions were often *easier* than some of the early normal match-ups, which was certainly not what I expected or what made sense to me. It certainly made it more possible to get to the finish of the game, but it was a little strange. Its possible that was simply an effect of the default difficulty, but I'm not sure. Without giving spoilers, though, the final championship battle is not the end of the game. A twist occurs that I thoroughly enjoyed, and lead me to play again right away to see if I could achieve a different outcome. Its honestly one of the best little bits of the game in my opinion.\n\nOutside of the game itself, I should mention that I sent some feedback to the devs about the surrender mechanic (which is terrible, imo) which has  you click spamming to save a gladiator if they surrender. They got back to me in two days, and while their response was wishy washy, that's still a good turnaround for communication. Thought that was worth mentioning. \n\nOverall, its a good bit of fun, if not ground-breaking. On its own, I can't say I'd see it going for more than $10, and personally for what I got out of it I'd want to spend more like $5 - 8.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "42084349", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1526574813, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1526553367, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370976714", "playtime_forever": 365, "last_played": 1546425244, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "6/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "42079598", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1526553367, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1526475082, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010724198", "playtime_forever": 928, "last_played": 1526115076, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Nice style and good humour.

I personally don't use the mind control mechanic where you can take manual control of one of your gladiator during a match, I like to try to manage my gladiators as best I can and then cheer them on during a match. It's fun to immerse yourself and actually pretend you spent a lot of time and money on your fighters, so each win feels incredibly satisfying.\n\nPlus if you happen to be a twitch streamer, this game has twitch intergration that I've never seen another game implement. You can link this to your account and your viewers act as the crowd within the arena and can decide to cheer or boo during a fight. Cheering grants you a few extra gold and booing detracts gold.

I personally really enjoyed it, but I don't think it's a perfect game. Here's what to expect from it:\n\nThis is a super fast paced management game. Every few days you're signed up for a gladiator match-up and it's up to you to decide if your men are ready to take up the challenge. As you wait for the days to go by you can train, win favor with political parties, or sign up for pit fights to further level up your men. Pit fights are a gamble since you can't see your opponents stats. \n\nGoing into this game blind, you probably won't be successful on your first go around, but I think that's sorta the point. This game has great replay value, mainly based off of the fact that it really just throws you into to the action practially saying \"Good luck kid, go get em!\" While you're training your absolutely worthless slave like \"AM I DOING THIS RIGHT?\"\nAlong with sometimes hilariously fast fights, and a few small graphical glitches, these are really the only downfalls of this game. \n\nThe pixel art is simplistic but gorgeous, the music just really gets you into it, and the crowd constantly reminding you how much you look like somebodys grandmother all add up to what I feel is a fun and unique experience. Also the few special events spinkled throughout are sometimes hilarious if you make certain choices, and can even give you chances to blackmail people (Which is pointless tbh but funny as hell)\n\nI would say wait for this to go on sale. As the game is, I just don't see it being a $10 game. If you're interested in buying, just throw it onto your wishlist and you'll be reminded of it when it's on sale.

There needs to be more options to training\n- Not nearly enough variety in terms of fights, at first the fights are quite appealing, but they get stale fast\n- Needs bosses. The tournament bosses are easier than the random fights you have to face.\n- Get rid of the horse races, they are so pointless\n- More animals, like elephants\n- The people you can employ don't do enough\n- Add colour options to armour, so you know which gladiator is yours when you are facing other max armoured gladiators\n\ntl;dr - there is not enough content, the game is too easy to steamroll. \n\nI will gladly change my review if most of these content related issue are updated, because this game at its core is a really good game, just not a whole lot to do unfortunately.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "41423846", "weighted_vote_score": "0.713132381439208984", "votes_up": 24, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1537725840, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1523474721, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073983462", "playtime_forever": 364, "last_played": 1519867354, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "In this game, you play as the female head of a major family during the final decline of Rome; you must push past sexism and cultural depravity to raise the greatest stable of gladiators the world has ever seen.\n\nIt's a story of female empowerment, but also stabbing.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41421783", "weighted_vote_score": "0.470297038555145264", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1523474721, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1523468366, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057544436", "playtime_forever": 68, "last_played": 1523414845, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "There is little guidance and your game can suddenly end without you even knowing.

However, the gameplay is a different story. [i]Domina[/i] suffers from many flaws, such as lack of balance between the enemy AI and your own gladiators, game mechanics, design choices, etc.\n\nEven from the start, there are seemingly \"pointless\" manual options. Things like training your gladiator combat level really should be enabled by default. The tutorial is not very good- you'll learn better from playing over time. In the beginning I was constantly doubting if I invested in the right upgrades.The actual battles are chaotic and very fast-paced, I'd recommend slowing time down 50% by pressing the '-'-' (minus) key just to get a better picture. There is an upgrade to let you manual control your gladiators, letting you exploit the enemy AI's weaknesses by dodging/rolling and spamming attack as you backpedal in the arena. Finally, (without spoiling the ending) the story mode is very short. You have 365 in-game days to prepare for the grand championship, which goes by quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the Endless (sandbox) gamemode a lot more fun for reasons above. Resource management (money, water, food, etc.) is less of a burden and getting Jupiter's Blessings buffs aren't really much of a pray-to-RNGesus mechanic. Besides the emotional turmoil you may endure, losing your best gladiator won't cost you the game! Spent much more time than I expected in Endless mode. It's fun to farm for the best gladiators, based on their personal stats (evasiveness, agression, amount of HP, attack/defend points). Call it survival of the fittest.\n\nYou can also piss off the Legate/Magistrate to get more challenging battles.\n\n\nBleed on!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41317963", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1523020330, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1523007866, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967136700", "playtime_forever": 2296, "last_played": 1552795914, "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8}, "review": "Its Soccer manager with swords,dismemberment,beheadings,gore and lions :) \n\nIts a lot of fun and good mindless entertainment. \ngood value and worth the price", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41315054", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1545461843, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1523002834, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079221112", "playtime_forever": 1532, "last_played": 1523222741, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "fun game, although a little bit more tutorial would be helpful", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41314015", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1523002834, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1522999444, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115322585", "playtime_forever": 584, "last_played": 1522954275, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "so I released my best gladiators...\n\n..but only the scrubs came at the end because I released them first.\n\ngg game", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41313352", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1522999444, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1522984725, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037557922", "playtime_forever": 1870, "last_played": 1530621519, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Ever since I watched the Spartacus series on TV, I have been craving a game that puts the gamer in the simulated role of a Ludus Lanista. \n\nOne morning, after finishing a round of Game Dev Tycoon, a Steam pop-up ad showed up as it usually does.

They are so cheap to buy, I really don't see the point of them being there.\n- You have to upgrade everything manually. Every goddamn shoulder and leg pad.\n- Sometimes gladiators ask to set them free. However, it is nearly impossible to know if it's your strong gladiators or your weak ones, unless you memorize names. Fun.\n- Occasionally fights take more than a minute, with two dudes rolling around but not doing any damage to each other.\n- Ending is goddamn cheesy.\n- Font type is hard to read and the graphics are worse than in the screenshots.\n\n\nPros\n- It is always fun to watch gladiators fight and it's thrilling if your dude wins.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "41230293", "weighted_vote_score": "0.566326260566711426", "votes_up": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1522682957, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1522666793, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010161453", "playtime_forever": 1094, "last_played": 1522666401, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Put in 20 hours before my first complete successfull playthrough.

You have to manage various tech trees (fighting styles, equipment quality, etc.) and the trade-offs are interesting.\n\nI love watching the fights, and the instant replay feature is cool.  Doubling-down on the video effects would be fun (e.g. a slow-motion if the last person gets decapitated).\n\nThe theme is also awesome and fits the gameplay well.  Every match could wipe out your favorite gladiator, but no risk, no glory!\n\nCons:\n\nThere is too much micromanaging in the equipment system.  Having to upgrade each gladiator's right shoudler pad is stupid and after a few gladiators I got sick of it and just clicked randomly (you have to click every body part to upgrade it and it upgrades once per click).\n\nThe pacing of the game is very broken.  The game looks at your gladiators and automatically arranges fights.  This means that if you have one really powerful gladiator, you can't build up the other ones because they will get slaughtered against high power enemies.  There is no way to know how difficult a boss will be before paying the entrance fee and entering the battle.  The per-gladiator level system is so powerful that you can end up falling backwards massively if your best gladiator dies.\n\nThe random events are also very boring.  Usually there's some story and you make some basic choices, then your stats either go up or down.\n\nFeedback to the devs:\n\n- Make the equipment system automatic the same way you can automatically train stats\n- Reduce the bonus from stats, just like in real life.

To be more specific, the game has extremely simple mechanics and most of the functions aren't even required to be there. For instance, you can spam buying food, water, etc and the costs are so low. And, yes, you'll need plenty of water and food. Another more obvious example would be this woman who prays to Roman gods of Mars (Ares), Juno (Hera), etc. She is imo one of the best wee helpers in the game and jeez who wants to click 'heal' to every single damaged character in lutus and spend so much time. Or it'd also be great if there was a button to auto increase morale of the characters. Idk how I really feel about those aspects but as to how the game feels like, it's a smooth 6/10 in comparison with the other games of its type. If you want to control your character, btw, it requires practice and the AI did, in my case, a lot better of a job than me so I just sat back and let the characters be controlled by the AI. If the speed of the fights could be adjusted that would definitely make me play the game for longer hours. Another button to auto train all characters would also be helpful. Btw, the bg music in fights is a solid 8/10.\n\nOverall, if you don't really mind some small unnecassary concepts that don't really affect the gameplay hugely you won't have problems.

At first, you can't control your gladiators in battle, and so the game is a sort of Roman Pokemon, where you send out your best and hope they don't get slaughtered.\n\nVery soon, you research \"Mind Control\", which lets you actually play as one of your chosen gladiators and spill some blood in the ring and bathe in the glory yourself.

Remember: Always fight courageous, with honor and - most importantly - give them a spectacle they won't forget!\n\n\n[b]Oldschool in all the right ways[/b]\n\nDOMINA is a gladiator school management game set in ancient rome. The empire struggles to maintain stability, barbarians are at the doorstep and instead of doing something about it, the Romans decide to go out partying. Of course they weren't Romans if that didn't include arena fights to the death.\n\nThe presentation is wonderfully oldschool. The pixelated characters are abstract enough that your own imagination comes into play, but not so abstract that you can not tell who is doing what. It strikes a great balance.\n\nThe soundtrack is, in a word, dope. Instead of an epic orchestral movie-like soundtrack you get fat electronic beats that seriously belong on the dancefloor. I guess this is bignic's trademark, one thing I already loved about the Corporate Lifestyle Simulator (a game that I played through in one sitting, which is a rare - and not too bad - thing these days). Needless to say I got the soundtrack for this game as well (though on bandcamp, not on steam).\n\n\nIt should be noted that, while I found the game to be tremendously fun, not everything is perfectly balanced. Not all of the staff you can hire are equally useful, and it seems the three different classes of gladiators aren't equally useful as well. Also, in addition to arena battles there are chariot races as well you can enter. These are completely optional and are supposed to earn a lot of money; however, I could never win one of these. Sometimes, an enemy's chariot that has lost its wheels is still faster than your tricked-out and healthy chariot, a well-trained horse and your best gladiator. But maybe there's something I forgot or didn't pick up on - DOMINA is a game that pretty much throws you into the pit (pun intended) and expects you to survive - or perish. Oldschool, like I said.\n\nOh, and you technically *can* control one of your gladiators yourself in a fight once you research 'mind control'.\nThat doesn't mean you *should*, however; gladiators with AI skill at 100 are so. much. better.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, DOMINA's main game mode, campaign, is a lot of fun. RNGesus can throw some funny, interesting or just mean events your way, which is fun and also fits with the overall oldschool feel of the game. And without wanting to spoil too much, there is an event at the very end of the game where the outcome is decided by your actions throughout the game. Gave me goosebumps all over when it happened, even though I had a general idea of what was going to happen. Overall, finishing the campaign took me a little less than 6 hours.\n\nAs for the (as of yet experimental) endless mode, I haven't tried that, but I asssume it'll give you a bit more freedom and opportunities in the long run, whereas the campaign limits your game to one year's time.\n\n\nIn any case, there are few things as gruesome, and outright bloody amazing as getting to throw a group of your most experienced and well-equipped gladiators at a bunch of fighters from another ludus. The word that comes to mind is 'meatgrinder'.\n\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\n\nIn a gesture appropriate for a gladiator school management game set in ancient rome I give DOMINA a big THUMBS UP. If you're open to trying new things, enjoy lots and lots of blood and a soundtrack that gets said blood pumping, look no further than this game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41150174", "weighted_vote_score": "0.522293031215667725", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1522407882, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1522383956, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029647355", "playtime_forever": 757, "last_played": 1517723071, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "My lvl 200 Honorius got slaughtered in a pit fight in 3 seconds.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41144360", "weighted_vote_score": "0.466427475214004517", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1522383956, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"timestamp_created": 1522376244, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166572347", "playtime_forever": 403, "last_played": 1522375480, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Got it for 1 dollar\n\nVery repetitive\nPoor variation of strategies\n\nI did a lot of exhibition matches for nothing :(\n", "comment_count": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "41142744", "weighted_vote_score": "0.439388513565063477", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1522376244, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1522357443, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009721177", "playtime_forever": 228, "last_played": 1539699247, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Great gameplay, amazing music...

The UI/UX is also an issue, it isn't really user friendly sometimes and the font is hard to read. The victory/defeat screen is annoying in the fact that it scrolls down for no reason while the stat increases haven't appeared yet, so you keep have scroll up to see what has changed. You having everything in the same screen without having to scroll would nice.\n\nThere's also an issue with the surrender mechanic. The game tells you to click as fast as you can, but you barely can react to it because it happens during the victory/defeat screen while it's scrolling down. It seems broken because nothing happens when I click on it. Bug?\n\nThe tutorial is kinda pointless, it doesn't explain everything the game has to offer. I had to find out most things on my own. \n\nLike I mentioned before, battles end waaay to fast. This part is the main aspect of the game besides managing your ludus (your home). Most fights barely last for 3 seconds before they end. Why have fights if they are super short? Fights should take a minute or two. This would increase immersion and tension.\n\nA lot of the game's mechanics are really interesting and fun but feel like they aren't really fleshed out enough. You have tech trees and abilities to unlock but it feels like they hardly matter. It seems like your gladiators is all what matters. \n\nYou can upgrade your home to speed up training or to farm resources which is nice. You can also hire staff with different abilities but in the end you keep using the trainer, the blacksmith and the doctor because you basically need them in order to take care of the basics leaving only one spot left. I hired an architect. What also annoyed me was that once you fire someone every upgrade you bought is lost and you have buy them again once you hire them. WHY? If I have all the abilities the trainer has to offer why should I keep him? I could hire someone else instead that is of more use.\n\nYou get the ability to control one of your gladiators, which sounds really cool but feels super clunky. The AI is also way faster than you so you end up letting the AI control your gladiators all the time in order to avoid losses.\n\nThe bosses are unique, look cool but fight like any other regular gladiator. Having some custom effects for each boss would've been cool and make them stand out more.\n\nI've gotten a lot of horses for chariot races, but I never got a chariot nor do I know how to get one? Do I need to buy it? Do I wait for a random event to happen? Do I win one from a gladiator fight? Who knows...\n\nBut I did have fun playing this game, it can get really addictive once you have a couple of strong gladiators and the victories start rolling in! Losing a gladiator hurts so you want quickly train one to take his place.\n\nOverall the game is average, it has potential and could be great if changes could be implemented. But as it is, it feels a bit unpolished and gets dull over time. Try this game out when it's on sale.\n\n I'd love to see a sequel for this, because I really like what this game is trying to do.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "41053584", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1522019357, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1522002047, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974417010", "playtime_forever": 832, "last_played": 1522001483, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Amazing game!

So much so, that I barely took control of my gladiators. I just let them butcher each other to pieces while controlled by the AI. Followed by some kickass synthwave music, it was that much fun. The core loop of upgrading your players, managing upgrades and basic resources is very satisfying. \n\nCons... it's incredibly limited and simplistic for a management game. I can see that the developers tried to spice it up with some random encounters in the form of text prompts, such as: \"The Gauls have your man hostage: what do you do?\". The thing is, these are random and also very limited. There is a half-baked mode with chariot racing as well, but instead of diversifying the game it's just frustrating.

I saw it when it was first released and didn't think anything of it really...seemed neat, so I put it on my wishlist so that I could easily keep and eye on it.\n\nA bit of time has passed now and I happened to get included in a bundle I purchased and decided to fire it up and give it a try.....7 hours later, I noticed that it was 3:00am lol I don't normally have late sessions and I was amazed at the amount of time that passed since I don't have a clock in direct view where my desk and such is situated lol. SO BE WARNED!! If you value your time, this game will gladly be happy to steal it from you!\n\nI did a story playthrough and now I'm a few years in with an endless game. The concept is pretty neat and kinda unique. It follows along the same lines as a management sim I suppose, but in Ancient Roman times.  You don't do much really, it's fairly simple (but must be crazy complex to develop!).  You play as somewhat of a slave master/gladiator trainer. Without getting too deep into it here (spoilers essentially aren't possible) you basic train your people and put them in arena style fights for cash and prizes and manage your resources - those being cash, food, water and wine. You can eventually get to a point where you can control a fighter in field if you wish, but I've only done it once. Honestly, the AI is done extremely well with this game so I've just enjoyed watching the fights play out automatically.  You can even \"befriend\" lions if you're lucky and use them as fighters too lol (you'll occasionally have to face them in the arena as well).\n\nOne word aside from that which has been mentioned, the races are kinda not the greatest at this point. They're probably still being developed, but at this point they don't play out all that great. The chariots constantly get tangled together falsely causing everyone to get completely damaged fairly early on 7 times out of 10 and horse stats don't seem to play a role. Currently I have a level 15 horse with his other stats maxed and you rarely get races where the others are ranked over 3 and it still becomes a fight to the finish when it would logically make sense that mine should be rocketting by everyone lol - oh well though. I'm sure it's something that'll be addressed.\n\nApart from that, like I say, arena fights are basically flawless. I've only had one bug where my fighter and the guy he was up against both go stuck in the decorative columns and couldn't reach eachother so I had to quit to the main menu...but nothing was lost since it autosaves everyday anyway and the fight went fine after reloading. The blood splattering everywhere is pretty awesome lol...strange that it's pink, but kinda fits the overall palette I suppose.\n\nI give this game a strong 8.5/10!\nGet it and check it out!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "40989650", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1521795446, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1521785813, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042702642", "playtime_forever": 1168, "last_played": 1521912175, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Very satisfying to beat.

Which I followed to the dot, because nothing else in the game is explained in any correct manner.\nThe battles themselves, which I presume is the core mechanic to the game; despite spending the least amount of time in it, is confusing, complicated, and goes way too fast. Or at least it did until I found out you could slow the game down, which ...why isn't this immediately pointed out? I see no excuse. Heck, you could've made it so that you can't get achievements when you're controlling time, so you could at least get the hang of it.\n\nThe most important thing in the game; time in days, is displayed as a single number. Not a clock. No sounds to know it's a new day. Just a single number that counts down pseudo-randomly whenever you're not in a menu.\nThe second most important thing I presume was money. Which really was only used to buy equipment, because everything else was cheap as heck. But if your gladiator dies, you don't even get anything of said equipment back.\n\nProgression means absolutely nothing. You know your best fighter? Here's the other fighter you're fighting that's just as good, if not better. You'll practically never get battles for the rest of your gladiators. Making it a ridiculous mechanic.\nDespite it being the screen you look at the most, the best training is having your fighters fight among themselves, or by taking a gamble by sending them into the pit (it's less of a gamble once you memorized the dozens of pixel art equipment). Stats increases so ridiculously faster in battle that training is practically useless, something I found out halfway through the game.\nNumbering systems mean nothing to these devs, as gladiators level exponentially in battles, yet their stats are directly linked to said stats. Making it ridiculously easy to get a max level gladiator after level 40, ready to be sold, freed, or just because you feel like it, killed. Killing is a bad thing mkay. Except in the Colosseum.\n\nThe automatic AI is moderately fun to watch, although there's not much strategy or variety in it, and after watching it about 3 times it gets stale. The people with the highest stats win, practically always. There's no such thing as an underdog. If your guy is a lower level, he simply won't do damage to the other guy. Blood just splatters everywhere, but no damage!\nSo when you decide to control one of your gladiators yourself, you must make sure you remember to click which guy to play; which is great if there's 9 people participating because you can't select the 9th and strongest guy. And at random times it'll just not select someone automatically. Finally, the game never automatically selects the strongest warrior you have.\n\nWhen you get your random battle screen, the screen has this cutesy way of scrolling through all the possibilities, despite the host disposition already telling you who'ss hosting, the amount of fighters already being set, and the enemies being set, meaning the randomization animation is an absolutely and entirely useless gimmick.\n\nIt has this ridiculously annoying and meticulous card system where you drag cards into off-screen slots, as opposed to simply putting them on them through their stats screen.\nSpeaking of, scrolling through the stats screen makes zero sense. I still haven't been able to figure out how they're sorted. It's not level, not name, not chronologically, not training position (the one thing that would make sense and that you can control). But what it actually is? God knows, but it's a missed opportunity.\n\nThe chariot races are a joke. The controls are horrendous, and simply not responsive. The mechanics are completely broken and buggy. I've literally killed my own gladiator because he was moving at Mach 3 speed. I don't know how my gladiator gets killed half the time when he does get on the cart.\nOh, carts! You can get horses, and carts, and apparently also a lion. This is something I found out in the last 50 days of the game. I never had the luck to find either with the Magistrate or the Legate.\n\nThere's a small few positive things though. I liked the wit of the game, got a good chuckle out of the events that happened. And I definitely liked the ending, with the twist, and especially with how quickly I had won. But that's about it.\n\nAll in all, this game is a buggy, unoptimized, untested, complicated and badly explained mess.\nIf at any point this game looks interesting to you, put it on your wish list, buy it during a sale.\n\nP.S: It baffles me how this game has gotten so many good reviews.

You assume the reigns of the failing gladiator school from your father who has let it fall into disrepair. Tasked with bringing back glory to your family name by making it to the Championship at the Arena, you will buy slaves, train warriors, collude and coerce with politicians and generals to further your gains, all the while managing enough food and water to keep your gladiators happy. \n\nAt first, it seems like a lot to take in but the short and sweet tutorial will get you on your feet quickly. There is a bit of a learning curve, but when you find out how to equip your gladiators for success it's a riot to watch them in the Arena. The sprite visuals are delightful and the music chiptunes are great throughout. While this game isn't super long or involved, it will keep you coming back for some laughs and try to out new and differing strategies to make it to the Championship, and survive the events.\n\nWhat's really impressive about this Indie gem, it was mostly created by one man, Bignic. While the game may be pushing the limits of it's asking price at $9.99 USD, I would recommend anyone with the money to spare, to please support this game and purchase it.

A common issue i'm seeing with Domina is that it has an incredibly high amount of redundant or useless mechanics. Let me just list a few off:\n\n-Happiness for Legate and Magistrate is poorly balanced, and essentially forces you to perform Exhibition matches every 5-10 days. Using wine to appease them is utterly useless by about the tenth time. \n\n-The tech tree is horrible. It essentially keeps you from training your gladiators as the other two available classes unless you intentionally grind for it. Costs for upgrades feel really random, and some upgrades are insanely OP, while others are not (+25% damage increase!?!? Good lord).\n\n-The variation between classes is almost nothing, and all three classes have access to the exact same lines of armor, but some will not have the full \"depth\" available. Their special abilities compared to a Thraex make them worthless to grind for.\n\n-The armor and weapon system is missing a lot of depth too. Rather than having a simple +Defense modifier for EVERY piece of armor regardless, the game would function a lot better if there were different types of defense like slashing and piercing, or if the armor protected specific body parts.\n\n-When doing a pit fight, the \"click to save your gladiator\" shit is literally impossible to do\n\n-Chariot races have bad mechanics and should probably be removed as a whole\n\n-Training rewards for winning a match in the arena still feel way too high\n\n-Blessings of Jupiter have the same issue as the tech tree; some perks are super OP and others are not. Spawn rate for worker-related blessings are way too low\n\n-Some workers are way more useful than others, especially when you consider the fact that when they are fired, their bonuses are removed\n\n-The architect's stone/fire pit/etc. upgrades take way too long to complete for the entire Ludum\n\n-Dialogue options often times do not feel like they have a lot of weight to them, and other times they feel like they are determinate upon random chance almost entirely\n\n-The Championship system makes it so that you can only challenge champions within about the last 100 days of the campaign\n\n-Min/maxing for anything other than strength feels useless, so naturally everyone will be doing this\n\nThose are all of the non-combat mechanics. Here is a list of combat issues I am seeing:\n\n-Lack of depth. You have four options: swing, block, roll, or throw weapon (which is too risky for no reward)\n\n-Impossible to separate yourself from enemies once the battle is started. No stunning, no sprinting, etc. \n\n-Missing essential combat mechanics like parrying, riposte, shield bash, etc. that I see in a ton of other melee combat games\n\n-Game would benefit immensely from a hold-power directional swing system, where the person will increase the power of their swing the longer they leave themselves open to hits and hold down the swing button\n\n-Group battles are a BLOODBATH. There is no way of strategizing to save all of your gladiators. You just have to hope and pray that they will all win, otherwise a common method would be to send one OP gladiator to kill the other group, which is just spammy and not fun\n\n-On a related note, Ludum composition is not important, because as mentioned earlier, classes have almost no differences between one another\n\n-A general lack of effects like blinding, cripple, etc. that dates all the way back to DnD and can add a ton of depth to combat as well\n\n-Generally feels like you are spamming the hit button between blocks, and at a certain point, blocking will literally not block all damage, and instead only a part\n\n\n\nOnce again, there are a lot of things about this game that I like, and I see so much potential for this to become a true classic game. but I am seeing way too many mechanics that have no thought put into them. The game is missing a huge amount of balance, and until it reaches the point where decisions in and out of combat have weight, I would have to tell the average consumer not to buy the game. \n\n\n\nEDIT: As of late, the dev has been releasing a lot of updates; About 1-2 per week. So far quite a few bugs have been handled, as well as some small gameplay changes. I see some potential for me to change my review in the future, but for now there have not been any monumental changes to the gameplay.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "40747160", "weighted_vote_score": "0.577511906623840332", "votes_up": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1532308393, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1520787150, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110749416", "playtime_forever": 212, "last_played": 1526020840, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Gets one good Gladiator.

If I'm controlling a fighter I always have speed on the lowest\n- The narration is downright ridiculous at times, some of the crowd comments feel like a badly written porno.  There's no screaming crowd roaring for blood, but rather weird dudes shouting stuff like \"HEH, MASTURBATOR\".  Not to mention \"Cock Sheaths\" being an item name.  Like jesus, tone it down a bit.  Even aside from the numerous sex jokes, it feels less  like a gladiatorial arena and more like a primary school playground.  No epic \"THOSE WHO ARE ABOUT TO DIE SALUTE YOU\", just some funny voice that says \"Go Grandma!\" among other things.\n- Managing supplies is more or less a nuisance, and the only time supply shortages were actually a problem is when I forget I even have supplies.  Costs just a few gold to top up all the resources whenever you need it\n- It's really difficult to tell who your allies are in the heat of battle, so sometimes I end up randomly slashing and when someone wins I'm not even sure if the dude is mine or not when the victory screen comes up.\n- Upgrades are really linear and there's no real difference between classes.  You can set all your guys as tharaxes(?) and you'll do just fine.  Classes are basically just tharax, tharax but with TWO SWORDS, tharax but with a jabby weapon and a net.  No real incentive to customize anything other than just spam clicking everything until you don't have enough money, because lighter armour doesn't offer any speed/mobility benefits.\n- I have a horse but there's no instruction on how I even use him anywhere.  Can't enter him into a duel, can't drag him onto someone, I have no idea what to even do and the game doesn't really tell you\n- There's no challenge involved in the sort of political influence side with the legate/magistrate and even the management of your gladiators.  Never put anyone to death, never sold anyone, never even granted anyone freedom, there just isn't much reason to.  Just spam wine at anyone who isn't feeling fantastic and you're all set - wine is so cheap you can do this if you're broke either way.\n- If I let the AI control my gladiator they just get themselves and 500 gold worth of gear mangled out of the gates.  But if I control the gladiator I basically win 100% of the matches.  The end result is I can effectively dump my entire bank into one or two guys, and never face any real challenge because as long as I'm controlling one I always win.  Meditation (AI skill) shouldn't be something you train separately, but something that goes up automatically with each battle participated in.\n- On top of that, controlling the fighter basically amounts to spam left click, block if they attack until they roll or stop, spam again.  There's no stances or types of attacks, it's just spam clicking.  \n\nConclusion: I really really want to like this game, but the actual management aspect is extremely shallow and easy, the voice lines are just silly and kinda ruin the immersion, and the battle system itself could use a lot more depth, especially in regards to your allies - it seems like their goal isn't to win but just to kill themselves as fast as possible.\n\nI'm writing such a long review because I really do like this concept, and I think the game has a lot of potential.

Just to note, I've already completed the game and that was after restarting too, so it doesn't last long. \n\nIt's a pixel sim where you manage a ludus for a year in order to win a championship. You train your gladiators, gear them up, improve your ludus and micromanage your reputation with two NPC's.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get started.\n\n1. Quickly hire 3 of the NPC's on offer. The Architect and the chap who repairs and upgrades armour are safe bets, 3rd one is up to you (perhaps the Medicus?). Build training poles and upgrade the armourer so he constantly repairs and upgrades your gladiators armour.\n2. Constantly upgrade your Doctore. By the end of the year, you should have almost everything unlocked.\n3. Use the option for exhibition matches as often as possible. This is by far the quickest way to train your gladiators, and it's the easiest way to better your relationship with the Magistrate and the Legate. Just don't forget to heal your men afterwards if you don't have the Medicus.\n4. You don't need 15 gladiators to win the game, I did it with 12. When you win a match, you get gladiators. If you have a few well trained, well equipped gladiators already, consider setting free any new ones. This boosts the morale of your other gladiators. Sell any that you don't need but are already equipped with gear.\n5. Don't be afraid to reject a match if it's not favourable. Look at the opponents stats, which give you a good indication of the challenge. It's all RNG, so one match could see your top fighter get obliterated in seconds, and the next could pit five of your men against one who's weaker than each of your fighters individually.\n\nDon't get frustrated if you find you lose your best gladiator. Keep doing step 3 and all your gladiators will be more than powerful enough. Selling those you don't need will keep you in good gear. \n\nI hope the game is added to at some point, if it had more content it would definitely be worth the full price.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "40473129", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1519918838, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1519857599, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016100725", "playtime_forever": 401, "last_played": 1520107401, "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "The one thing I have a problem with is that it seems whenever I max out a gladiator, the game automatically scales every encounter to match my champion.\n\nSo it's all fun and games until one has the best gear because after that you'll be heading towards 1-5 enemies with that very same gear all of a sudden. This, I feel, needs to change.\n\nAnd if it's a 1 vs Many ruleset so you can only bring one gladiator, you're either stuck with a 50/50% chance on sacrificing your champion or 100% death sentence for any lowbie you may have instead. Unless you have a special Blessing of Jupiter that has the \"Your gladiator deals 2500% increased damage but can never heal beyond 50% health\" upon which you start dealing 2k damage per hit, no chance for enemies to evade and their max health is 1k so you just one shot anything and everything.\n\nHowever besides that, the game difficulty is perfect! Once I noticed that an enemy only dealt 3 damage to my 190 health guy while not defending, so I thought to myself \"huh, he does no damage so I guess there's no point in defending against him, this will be easy\" and not two seconds later my own gladiator had been killed. Smacked into Oblivion in a 2-hit combo, my gladiators head rolling around in the arena.\nYou cannot relax for one bit if you want to keep your gladiator. The moment you stop caring is the moment the opponent immediately beheads you.\n\nIt's a very fun game, easily worth the 10\u00a3 but I got it at the 66% discount.

How there are an iota of positive ratings, I have no idea.\n\nI bought the game today because it looked somewhat interesting in the past, and since it was listed at $4, that seemed acceptable. Nothing about it was impressive, and the price it's typically listed at seemed a bit steep.\n\nIt was not just a \"bit\" steep. It's absurd. This game is worth less than $5. It's honestly absymal. It's trash.\n\nI expected a game that was similar in vein to something like Punch Club, albeit without the ability to walk around a map and go to other locations. It advertises itself as a game where you can train your gladiators, manage things, then send them to fight... right?\n\nNo.\n\nYou can't do that. You start the game and immediately you are forced to battle with one of your three. I won, that's cool. Okay, so now it goes back and I want to check out each gladiator's stats, what I can do with them, how to train, what options I have to maximize the efficacy of my training methods before sending them in to fight.\n\nIn the upper-right corner you see the game tells you a number for time left before the next fight. I'm thinking, \"Okay, I get to train and that count decreases by one. If I choose to train the same gladiator 3 times, it's time to fight. OR I can choose to train each of my starting three once. The next fight might call for a group battle, or a one-on-one, so I have to be careful how I spend my time.\"\n\nIf that were the case that would be amazing. Just what I was looking for.\n\nInstead the game just counts those down BY THE SECOND. That's right, each second you are not in a screen looking at the gladiator's stats, even if you haven't had a chance to right-click on one of them to tell them to start training, the game just counts down 3, 2, 1, HEY RANDOM BATTLE! You don't get a choice in the matter, you are forced to do this.\n\nThere is no \"strategy\" or \"management\" when a game forces you into the next encounter, without a way to even pause it from happening, so you can sit and calculate what you want to do.\n\nI don't see how the game has a single positive review.

I wasn\u2019t able to play anything else. \nI strongly reccomend this to all the management fans. \nTheres some hack and slash too since you can take control of one of your gladiators at a time.\nSo, what is Domina?\nIt\u2019s a pretty simple but challenging game about training and managing your \u201cludus\u201d in the ancient Rome. It\u2019s pretty RNG so if you hate that in your games, you may have an hard time here. You can face random events that basing on your decisions can affect your whole game, so carefully pick your decision.\nYou get to decide of the fate of all your slaves / gladiators: you can set them free raising the morale of your troops, put to death, sell them for money or train them and upgrading their gear in order to become your fighters. Making them fight is risky, if they die, they are lost forever, I saw myself losing my strongest fighter, it was painful :\u2019( but if they win/survive (they can also surrender at times) they gain experience, higher HP etc.\nYou can also boost with a very simple cards system that you drop fighting.\nYou can hire employees that can boost your gladiators or stats of various genre. You cant really change your base much amd can only hire a max of 3 employees so here is a limit.\nIts not a really long game, sometimes is just quicker to restart the game that for an expert-ish player will last an average of two - three hours. Your playthroughs will have an end.. there is also an endless mode which I haven\u2019t tried yet.\nReplay value is good, achievements are doable and fun. But dont expect the best product ever, it has its limits. Really worth the price and your time, with a quality OST like this, I can safely say that Domina is a well made product.\nSide note: I experienced a few crashes but the game loads very quick and save system is in real time so I never lost my data.\n\nThere a few more aspects of the game I havent talked about.

I read some guides before playing because I didn't understand basic mechanics in the game, I think the game would have been harder if not for doing that. There are very easy paths to victory if you know what you are doing. \n\nCritiques: \n1.  Resources are not an issue and you do not have to manage your purchases one bit, coin rolls in like the blood you spill. \n2.  Upgrading your gladiators' equipment is a funky system, you don't get to \"shop\" for items to min/max their stats, you simply keep upgrading their equipment in a scrolling fashion; not only do you waste coin that you don't need to manage, but it's mindless. \n3.  The employee balance is atrocious. There are at least 2 employees that you should always hire. In fact they are so essential that they should not be employees, but mainstays the way the other characters are. Because of this, and the fact that you should never be lacking in coin, water, food, and wine, much of the \"management\" aspect of the game is diminished. \n\nPros:\n1.  Has a good feel to it overall, after a few playthroughs I started to appreciate how violent and unfair a life centered around the arena may have been. \n2.  It's fun to upgrade your guys and have a few gladiators that you care about; they take care of you and you take care of them. \n\n\nBelow are my ideas for how the game could be better. If you don't care about that, stop reading right now and know that I do NOT recommend the game at full price. I got it for $3.39, and it's fine for that. \n\n==========================================================\nHow it could be better: \n\nI found myself wishing the fights had more variety and options. For example, the game would be more challenging and suspenseful if you and your opponent drafted your team before a fight. Right now you can see all of the opponents you are fighting before picking your own champions; this makes it incredibly easy to decide whose stats you want to increase from the fight (your warriors' stats increase massively if they win fights). If you only saw one opponent out of X, and drafted a champion in relation to only what you can see being put on the board by your opponent, the matchups would be much more balanced and interesting because I think you would need to have a greater variety of champions. For example, it would be wise to draft slaves or cannon fodder early in a draft in order to see what your opponent is willing to put on the board, then only put up your best champions toward the end of a draft if you really want to win that match. \n\nThe fights themselves do not see much variety. I found myself wishing that I could pit my best champion against 20 other lesser champions for a good show, but the game only gives you 5 opponents at most until the last battle. Also there seems to be little strategy or benefit to having a varied team. Dual wielders do boatloads of damage, and spearmen are agile and annoying, but when it comes to choosing a lineup against an opponent it doesn't really seem to matter the type of soldier you field. In fact the only thing that matters is HP and Damage -- if you have more of those stats, you will win. \n\nIt would be fun to have orders you could give before a match, and more experienced gladiators would do a better job of carrying out those orders. For example, you could tell your spearmen to stay in front of your other men, or play defensively until a net lands. Similarly, you could tell your dual wielder to parry and until the spearmen lands a net, then go in for a kill. Small strategy choices like this would help provide a feeling of management during battles that is simply missing right now. The crowd can throw weapons down into the pit, it would be nice if you could pay coin to throw weapons or even release animals in the middle of a fight. As is you are simply a spectator once the fight starts, unless of course you have mind control which I confess I have not even tried as it seems like a handicap more than anything. The AI is very quick at dodging and attacking, I would suggest letting them do it. \n\nOverall a cool game but I think it's obvious that the creators didn't take time to refine the game or balance it, they probably got it to a working state and released.

I might delete this upon more experiance but as of now, it's pretty fun. The story is very simple though I enjoyed it and the NPC's fighting was fun as fuck to watch. There are small stories of the gladiators that you control. I got invested in these people and I felt bad when they died well at the beginning I did. I tried to be a nice person and set a shit load of slaves free. Rome is a savage place and I learned that. Hearing my slaves/gladiators beg to be set free I treated them like kings and gave them like 60 bottles of wine like holy shit.  It's pretty fun being a manager during Ancient Rome. The sympathy of hearing my slave's messages for freedom quickly turned into a disappointing waste of time as I received the same dialogue asking to be sent free. Instead of feeling like actual people in a cohesive world, it felt like I was clicking my mouse and typing on my keyboard Aka it broke immersion. If the developers made a lot of different dialogue for the slaves I or something I would like it more but it doesn't change gameplay or anything I'm just into that crap.

Watch the results and adjust your strategy, equipment, etc. accordingly. Take your time to think through your options, and optimize every 'turn', whatever that may be (I was expecting each rest period between a fight to be a 'turn').\n\nI was a bit surprised to learn that this is a real time game. Not only in the fights, but also during the 'management phase'. In my first run through I'm patiently exploring the UI and figuring out how to spend my resources, when all of a sudden the 4 day lead time to the next fight is up. Turns out I have to rapidly click on all of my gladiators to get them to train (as opposed to standing around idle), or alternatively, pause during the management phase in order to take my time. This burden is lessened a bit by an in game option to 'enable automatic training', but this was so hidden in the UI I had to watch a YouTube stream of it to find out about it. Other things, like having your employees research different techs, has to be done manually in real time (so at the very least requires diligent pausing by the player). There is no option, as far as I can tell, to switch the management phase to a 'turn based' structure. \n\nThen combat. So at first glance it is automatic and AI driven - which is what I expected. However there is an early tech that allows you to control your gladiators in an 'ASWD+mouse clicking' sort of way. Based on streams it seems like you need to do this, since the early fighter AI is simply too poor (later it gets better). Again, this is not what was expected - the point of a management game is you don't have to manually click around in real time to do better. The last straw for me was when I researched a tech that allowed my gladiators to yield, and when I was losing a fight my gladiator yielded successfully. Phew. Then, before I realized what was going on, he was executed, apparently because I didn't button mash fast enough to save his life during a 'click fast to gain crowd favor for your yielded gladiator' mini game - I'm not interested.  \n\nThe pros of the game: the cool graphics, the incredible music, the interesting idea, are certainly there. For folks who want to dive in and manually control their fighters, this is probably a fun game.

You build up a few core gladiators that can crush most things, except it's most often just one or two instead of 4~6.

If the terms aren't good, you can bail, but you can't afford to miss fights in this game. Also, unlike xcom, because you only have a 2 good fighters, you just can't recover when one dies. Which will happen, because the game likes to throw comparatively godlike entities into normal matches on occasion. Also, the level of oppenents seems to be heavily affected by your best fighter. So if you don't very precisely balance your fights early, you'll lose your best man. \n\nA simple fix to this problem is to mix in weak fights and make it so that fighters gain experience proportionate to the skills of there oppenent. If little lv10 billy beats lv35 bloodthirster, he suddenly rockets up to lv30. If lv100 Humungo beats lv25 Johnny boy, he gets to be lv101.

Not sure about the full price though.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe with this game is that all 3 gladiator types play pretty much exactly the same way, all weapons work the same way, and all armors work the same way, so there's no real reason why you would want to train any other types of gladiators and use any other equipment combination (other than to max out the numbers) so your fighters can support each other in the arena. There's no reason why you would want to anyways, since it's mostly 1 on 1 or team vs team where the stats are the only thing that matters. Which sucks, because it feels like the arena portion of the game is very obviously programmed to do really good battles, because the fight results are less on the fighters's stats and more on their AIs, which can actually execute pretty good combat manuvers.\n\nOn top of that, when the magistrate and the legate showed up I fully assumed that there would be random events where I'd have to beg them for their assistances and mercies or suffer grave consequences and casualties. I also assumed there to be a massive numbers of random events that would drastically alter market supplies of goods and services. None of that happened. Instead bribing the magistrate and legate only serves to provide better slave and gladiator selections that I could purchase. There's absolutely no reason why you should grow your own crop, forge your own weapons, or build a bigger mansion. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it lacks varieties, especially in terms of situations that force players to make hard decisions.\n\nThat being said, you should still try this game out, especially if you love the management mechanics in games like Darkest Dungeon or Fire Emblem, where you can recruit and customize a roster of fighters that eventually turn into terrifying badasses.\n\nTL;DR: Cool concept.

There's really no collision boxes on the gladiators, and no friendly damage, so team fights turn into spastic deathballs with really no ability to read what's going on.\n\n1vs1 fights are much better, but still not particularly interesting.\n\nWorth 3 bucks, that's about it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "38984254", "weighted_vote_score": "0.49824562668800354", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1514919615, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1514917014, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033039425", "playtime_forever": 893, "last_played": 1531288481, "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": ">started the game\n>got pumped by title menu music \n>allready worth the money \n\n<3", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38982780", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1514986210, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1514914112, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051952262", "playtime_forever": 1165, "last_played": 1514615745, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Are you in the mood for finding a great management game that puts you into the times of Ancient Rome as the heiress to a Galditor Pit? OF COURSE YOU ARE! (Warning: I am not a professional critic, this is one of my first real reviews.)\n\nDomina is a game that puts you in the shoes of a wealthy heiress to a Gladiator Pit and learn the fundimentals of how one controlled their aggressive bunch of killers. you can train your gladiators in any category with the adjustments in their stats, as well as purchase new gladiators from either the Legate (essentially a roman general) and a the Magistrate (essentially a politician). Your goal is to win the final battle by the time the days end (unless you're on endless mode) and become the champion of Rome and obtain the hefty prize that would allow you to become one of the most powerful figures in Rome. You can essentially play in almost whatever terms you want (as long as you understand the mechanics of the gameplay). Do you have enough trust in your Gladiators level of A.I. to win the day? Or are you one who likes to take fate into your own hands and face the enemy head on? with the Mind Control perk you are capable of taking over your gladiator and keeping him alive to the best of your abilities. However I personally prefer to play without the Mind Control, for a leader could not control their soldiers every single movement, it was down to the soldier themselves.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics: I like the pixelated look personally, it adds it's own unique feel to the game, and I honestly don't know if the game would be the same Without this look.\n-Gameplay: It's a management game at it's finest, you can essentially control everything that happens from \"what type of people you hire?\" which leads to different benefits (Pro Tip: get the architect, they build permanant structures in your training field that increases the speed of your gladiators training, it's very good to get him early) to how your gladiators are training, what armor they are wearing, and even special perk cards you can add onto them and improve their skills and training speed.\n-Choices: Even tho this game focuses on the combat and training aspect, there are occasional moments where you are forced to choose between the Legate and the Megistrate on certain events. For example there could be a food shortage throughout the city and the MAgistrate is asking for X amount of Food, while the Legate is experiencing a drought in the border where his troops are patrolling, and he needs X amount of Water. You are in this situation forced to either help the legate and lose some water while making him happy, but upsetting the magistrate, helping the magistrate and losing some food while making them happy, but pissing off the legate, or you could choose neither and piss both of them off, but keep your resources. in the end each choice cna effect both the legates/magistrate's opinion on you (which means they may not pay for the expenses of one of your gladiators each) but can also effect the resources you need to stockpile.\n-Resource Management: The game is made in a way where it's incredibly easy to keep managing your resources, however you have to remember to keep buying each resource you need. Food and Water are essentials for keeping everyone fed and happy, while Wine is used to bribe the legate and magistrate to make them happy. However you cna get so preoccupied by managing your gladiators, making decisions and getting upgrades for your gladiators, that you can forget to get food and water sometimes. It doesn't help that they put the \"underground pit fights\" in the same place where you get food and water, so that can be a big distraction while you go into the menu just trying to get some resources you despreately need. All in all if you pay attention resources won't be an issue, just don't get distracted by your gladiators and your employees and you'll be fine.\n-Music: The music in this game is great. It is overpowering in situations like combat, and soft and gentle during decisions of choosing. It's the perfect mix of intense combative music and soft, calming music that helps you make good decisions in the game. Also if you pay attention you'll notice the music lines up with the game. I dare you to show me one countdown that doesn't line up with the hook to the song.\n-Dialogue: The Dialogue is unnerving and disturbing at times when it needs to be, and Hilarious at times when it needs to be. [spoiler](spoiler alert, there's allot of ball kicking from our female protagonist.)[/spoiler]\n\nCons:\n-A.I.: While I do like the idea of leaving the A.I to do it's thing, considering a leader never has full control over their soldiers. That doesn't change that the A.I. likes to do stupid things sometimes and lose to anoither gladiator who in all states was weaker then my dude, the only difference would be they had a higher A.I. scoring. So unless you plan on making it where you control your troops at all times, I recommend having your gladiators focus on A.I. training so they will have the best possible A.I. to pit up against the enemy. This does help with allot of victories. And while it is good that the A.I training shows results, that doesn't change that the A.I. can be just flat out silly sometimes and do stupid things and upset me.\n-Duration: if you Really played the game throughout the day, you could probably finish the overall champaign within about 1-2 hours, While I understand this is a management game and they can't go on as long as most other games without having a sense of repeatitiveness in it, that doesn't change that days can go by super fast (roughly every 5 seconds I think) and you only have a year to get ready, this doesn't leave allot of time to develop all of your troops, making it where you can't walk away or even Look away from the screen without pausing it if you expect to Win in the end. I will tell you now the difficulty of this game is pretty high, and the odds of you winning at the Very End are slim, I'm not gonna spoil anything about the ending, however that doesn't change that if you aren't prepared, you Will lose in the overall scheme of things. I still haven't technically won the game, but I have seen people on Youtube do it. So it's not impossible to win, it just takes all of your attention and timing skills to make your you use all the time at your disposal efficiently, which i'll be honest i'm not good at. So while this probably isn't an issue for hard-core management fans, if you are looking for some casual fun? this game is not for you, this game does have a difficulty factor to it, and only people who Truly understand the mechanics behind management games will get to the real ending on this game. That isn't to say the game isn't fun, it's just not for casual play (unless you're ok with watching your gladiators die to a sudden super buff enemy that will one hit them)\n\nTL;DR [spoiler](you ingrate)[/spoiler]: If you are a casual player this game isn't for you, winning requires all of your attention and thus casual play is not welcome here. If you are looking for a hard-core management game that requires most (if not) all of yo ur skills in a management game to win? get it right now, it's 66% on sale as I write this out.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38981173", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1514914112, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1514907106, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988341610", "playtime_forever": 616, "last_played": 1530313313, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I really liked this game, it does have small bugs etc. but also a good bit of entertainment.

If you can get this game around 5 bucks, do it! Sadly anything more would not be justified. \n\nWhy is that? Well Domina seems at first glance to be a managment game. There is tons of stuff to do, things to upgrade, settings to adjust, decisions to be made ...etc, however there are only a very few things which are actually viable to beat the game. \nDomina is about two things:\n-Knowing which fights to pick\n-Realizing which upgrades/workers make sense and which are more of a hindrance than anything\n\nThe game is not hard, it tries slow you down, throws random frustration scenarios at you, but that is it. This is the challange of a game and yes you can fail along the line, however i found this to be quite fun. I reset the game a few times when i got what i did wrong and adjusted. This is ok.\n\nI guess a lot of the people who dislike the game are disappointed. This is understandable as domina really has the basis for something grand. If the developers would flesh out the managment part of the game, expand the story a bit... boy this would be an awesome game.

You'll be faced with making the decisions of which Gladiators to send into which round, what area each Gladiator should train and improve in, what item of armor or weapon to improve and the hiring and firing of special Trainers to benefit your Ludus. Reward your Gladiators with coin, wine, and private room or, ultimately, freedom. Their moral goes towards how well they will fight for you. You must also manage your relations with the Legate and Magistrate, as it them who organise the matches, and how much the like/dislike you will help determine the odds against you.\n\nThe plays as you would imagine it would if you were in charge of the Ludus. You don't participate in the fighting. You can research 'mind control' which allows you to control a single Gladiator in battle, but when you see how fast battles play out, you are best leaving it to the professional... The A.I. Your job is simply to manage the numbers. Food, Water, Money and Wine, all are required to run your Ludus, and it is up to you to make sure you have enough. You ultimately work your way towards the 'championship' at the year's end. Ensuring your Gladiators are in top form for the final tournament. Your choices and management will be tested here, more than ever.\n\nJust like in the movie and the series, the game will throw you a curveball at times, setting  up a match that is obviously meant for you to lose. Sometimes you have to make a choice of sending your champion and risking his life for the win, or sending in your newest recruit to certain death. It is here that i would have liked to seen a bit more depth to the Gladiators. Giving the underdogs at least a chance of winning against the odds, and becoming something of a legend. However, its all about the numbers. How much Health, how much Damage, how much Defense. \nIt's nice to see sometimes your Ludus champion (your best Gladiator - think Krixis) still wounded from the previous battle, and your up and coming Gladiator step in for this match (think Sparticus) and win. Gaining both skill and fame, he becomes stronger. The two then become a deathly duo.\n\nThe music. Oh lord, the music. If you watched the trailer and it kinda grabbed you, it only gets better. The fight setups to the fight start times with the music perfectly. So that when it says 'Go' the music is in its beefiest. It's a shame you can't slow the matches down, so that you may appreciate the animation, bloodshed and music more. There are some rounds that are won with a single blow. \n\nThere are a few things i would like to see put into the game, but all in all, if this is on Sale, you would be mad to miss it. It will more than triple the amount of hours you play it for than the dollars you pay for it.\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38881996", "weighted_vote_score": "0.644341826438903809", "votes_up": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1514679358, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"timestamp_created": 1514673143, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036485584", "playtime_forever": 351, "last_played": 1515194088, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Very short and simplistic gladiator sim.

This mixes nicely with humoristic battle theme. On the other hand the game looks like quite blurry in some situations (for example the equipment view). \n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty simple but ruthless. Basically you are facing randomized but eventually improving gladiators and you need to choose which one of your own are you going to use / improve. \n\nAt the beginning your \"natural selection\" is your best gladiator but you also need to look at the big picture. At the end you need several gladiators but for that you need to improve each and every one. This creates a dilemma, you must find a way to improve everyone but first of all you need to do it SAFELY. It is mandatory to study your enemies carefully (pure number comparison + special cards). Any optimism is rewarded with death. And when your top dog is killed in early game the session is pretty much ruined. The fights with big teams with similiar characteristics ( = or ~ ) will bring you death or fortune (at the end you wont be a poor man anyway). Now I have told you :).\n\nThere are also events filled with black humor, minor scale base construction and human resource management.

You are a Domina of a once proud ludus, and you have to micromanage many aspects of your gladiator's daily lives, for instance food & water, training, equipment, morale, and ofcourse combat.  The pixel graphics suit this game very well along with the indie style and vulgar humor of the game.  Domina is downright hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud many times.  The micromanagement elements and perks systems adds nice depth to the game and always keeps you busy.  You can simulate the combat or take control of a gladiator.  The controls are simple and easy to use.  Combat is fast and bloody, and a blast to watch or play.  Although the games emphasis is more on managing your gladiators and your ludus.  Still there is a nice balance between the two, and the combat is so exciting and gruesome you never feel like your missing out.  The game also has a pleasant soundtrack.  Domina is on the shorter side though it has high replayability.  I highly recommend this little gem of a game.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31699029-The-Wisdom-of-Oz/] For more quality reviews, check out and follow my curator page!

As another reviewer put it, it's a mile wide but an inch deep. With the way enemy battle difficulty is decided I found it altogether too difficult to avoid ending up with 1 or 2 gladiators that were total powerhouses with everyone else in the dust, because trying to do anything but the very slow grind of pit fights with them ended up getting them slaughtered instead. Having a single gladiator capable of handling literally fucking everything is rather novel, but only until they up and run away one then the other days before the big fight, when you have three other gladiators that are only barely able to handle themselves on the fights that the two factions throw at you - and it's also not fun that those faction fights pick from your team, because when they picked a powerhouse gladiator (or both), the fights were nothing short of impossible. It actively encourages you to have a room full of gladiators with half of them untrained and unarmoured, as the rewards don't change when they pick a stronger or weaker gladiator. The NPCs you can all pick all seem really rather shallow. They're just various means of saving gold but also cost gold to keep around, and it's not like gold is hard to come by at the point when they're saving you the most gold anyway.\n\nIt also completely lacks any replay value. The changes you get in the game are the extent of what kinds of warriors you use, which NPCs you pick and which upgrades you pick, none of which change altogether *too* much, so even runs that you attempt to make very different from one-another will end up being fairly similar anyway.\n\nI would put forward a recommendation to the developers to make the random a bit more random - battles as a whole should last longer granting more opportunities for items from the audience, which themselves should have more of an impact. AI should also not ignore them entirely. The map of championship games should have a few variants that the game picks from, and completing one would allow you to move between them for more battles to pick from. Hand-issued challenges from behemoths, the frequency of which being determined by how many behemoths you've bested, would also be quite nice.\n\nThe game is certainly fun and well polished, and the soundtrack is pretty great, but it seems to be more polish than gameplay, and I would suggest giving this a pass unless it's on sale - as of time of writing, in the 2017 winter sale, a 66% discount seems more than amicable enough for me to feel I have not wasted my money, yet the full \u00a37 pricetag manages to be simultaneously relatively small yet also steep considering the lack of depth to the game.\n\nEdit: I also want to put forward that while I do not think the game is currently worthwhile, the developer does show to be listening and updates are fairly frequent, so I don't believe the game is irredeemable or particuarly *that* bad either.

A mile wide but an inch deep. I will admit that I did enjoy playing this, and probably will sink many more hours into this game, but at $10? It just isn't there. Granted I did buy it at $3, for $10 I would skip this.\n\nThe Good\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFighting in the arena is cool, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching fights and fighting in them. The crowd participating, lions, behemoths, and different classes keep it refreshing, up to a certain point. The regional fighting is a nice touch, allows you to progress and benchmark yourself, also gets you hyped for fights.\n\nGame is brutal, the way it should be, watching limbs fly and heads get chopped off adds to the score. The humor is also funny too.\n\nSound is nice. Goes well with theme, things that can be heard, and fits.\n\nFramework for politics, training, and running a ludus is there, and has many cool features.\n\nThe game is getting regularly updated and is continually being fixed, gives hope for the future.\n\nThe Bad\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEverything outside the arena is pointless, keeping good relations with those around you is useless, maybe it does affect your gameplay, but I have not seen it. There are not many options for doing things either with politics, only a couple options and you need to hire employees to unlock other options (which is cool and should be like that), but without the employee there are only a few things to do with your advisors. Should be more to do with politics.\n\nRandom events are also pretty lame, almost everytime it results in relations with your advisors, lose/gain resources, or gain a new member to your band of gladiators. Not much to do beyond here.\n\nTraining your gladiators is pointless, you can train a gladiator from scratch, give him all the necessary upgrades to speed up his training, yet he will still fall short even spending a whole year training him. There really is only a point in training a few stats, beyond that, pointless. Should be more emphasis here considering it is the basis of the game.\n\nWeapons/armor/classes, although there are many options, it all results to the same ending, buy the best gear possible. There really should be more freedom here, between three classes, it is quite clear that one class is significantly stronger than the others. Being able to customize gladiators in creating synergies and using certain combos would be a big step up from the basic linear, three class design.\n\nGame feels like a grind but isn't. What I mean by that is that it should take a while before you get beefy warriors, it really only takes a couple fights before you have a gladiator that can shred his way to the championship. I did notice you can turn up the difficulty in the options and did. The game was still far too easy and still followed the same path.\n\nGame in the end just felt bland, needs everything upgraded for it to feel like it has a place, more depth needed. Maybe add mod support? Would definitely add many more hours to gameplay as well as giving ideas on what to do in the future.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal Verdict:\n\nIs it worth it? $3, yes, $10, no. Simple as that, I wish there was more to this game but there really isn't. Maybe I will change my mind in the future, but for now, take it as it is.

In order to do that, you need to positively develop your relationship with a Legate and a Magistrate, otherwise, they won't make your life easy. Every now and then you're gonna receive a random message presenting a certain situation. Depending on your choice, you can get either a positive or negative outcome.\n\nYou can get to manage several different gladiators and there're 3 different classes available, each one with their own gear and unique aspects. Besides them, there're also some other crew members that you can get to hire in order to get access to some interesting improvements and fighting skills. You can't hire all at the same time, unfortunately. During your fights, you can also grab some cards that can offer some quite significant bonus to your gladiators. As for the resources, there're three different ones available: Water, food and wine (which you can use to bribe people).\n\nOk, now for an overall analysis: The graphics are simple but nice at the same time. The sound effects are great, and the soundtrack is also really cool. The story isn't really that complex, but who cares anyway, it doesn't make much difference. The gameplay is ok too, I mean, not only when it comes to managing your staff, but also when it comes to actually take control of one of your fighters on the arena.\n\nFrom what I'm seeing, the developer is still creating some new content for this game, so I'd like to leave a couple suggestions:\n\n1-) Exhibition mode: That way, you can get to create matches of your own, or simply play a versus mode against a friend of yours;\n2-) Player profiles: So some other people at home can also get to play the game, without interfering with your progress;\n\n\nIf you're still in doubt after all that, I recommend to just give it a try.

I wish there was a borderline button. I really do, but its a no. \n\nDomina reminds me of fallout shelter meets gladiators yet lacks the depth fallout shelter had. \n\nUltimately its a very shallow management game. You train your galdiators, you fight them, you get better equpiment, you fight regional tournaments and then win at rome. Sounds good, right?\n\nThe problems:\n\n- training is useless, your gladiators earn a bazillion times more experience just fighting constantly. Even when they take serious damage, have a healer on hand and they will be fine in a day or 2. Never missed a battle due to injury. \n\n- The combat looks cool but its absolute chaos. You can take control, but the computer is honestly going to be a lot better than you are at it because its breakneck fast.\n\n- combat doesnt matter anyway, after about 5 victories your gladiators become utter monsters. My first dude solod the game. He even solo ran the last bonus level at the end (no spoilers, but those who have completed the game know what I mean). Turn that on AI control and let them just steamroll everything\n\n- There are no gladiator builds. All galdiators are ultimately the same, one of them gets a sort of net throwing function, but its very meh and I have only seen it work once. Man with shield generally slaps everything to death anyway. there is no point upgrading your trainer to train the other styles. Not only are you gifted the other fighting styles from winning in the arena anyway, but they are ultimatley the same.\n\n- the game has no depth. Minus repeatedly telling your gladiators to continue their (pointless) training, and telling the architect to repeatedly build training equpiment, there really isn\u2018t a lot to do in between fights. its kind of like these farmville games. You just click on shit to keep the process going. Its all very meh. \n\n- the game has no scaling. You either get pathetic dudes or steam trains. There is zero middle ground really. There are no fights that scale with your fighters. Generally my wweak fighters only get better during 5 on 5 matches where the death machine solos the entire enemy team in the time it took the newbie to cross the arena. \n\n- I completed it in 2 hours in one playthrough and accicdentally go tthe good ending. I didnt even know it was coming, I was just plodding along building a team of death machines when they informed me the finals were here. I thought I was severely unprepared hahahahaha....I was not.

It is a game about an angry lady punching people in the groin until she gets what she wants: Fame and fortune.\n\nEverything in the game is subordinate to its central theme, one of the raw emotions of brutality and frantic decline.  There's no social message involved here, mind - it's merely a snapshot of order on the edge of chaos.  From the expletive-laden, cynical and harried writing, to the constant meatgrinder of new slaves into the maw of the arena, the frentic and gory gladiatorial combats, quick moments of rapid action punctuated by towering sprays of viscera, to the techno thumping soundtrack and roaring crowds giving a sense of a concert on the edge of a riot, even to the fact that the management of the game runs in very rapid real time, everything in the game is calculated to feed into the feel of the wanton destruction of diminishing plenty, of empty and half-empty beer bottles hurled from a rooftop into the alley below for the sheer joy of watching them break, of everything goes to hell and people grasping frantically for whatever snatches of pleasure they can pull from the dying corpse around them, cost what it may.\n\nIt's a very impressive production, and I admire greatly the discipline of the devs - it's rare to see someone who understands the importance of coherence and is willing to drive everything around a central theme.  On the whole I appreciate it, but the devotion to theme does come with certain costs the devs presumably deemed acceptable.\n\nNotably, the gameplay isn't - at all - the careful, stolid management sim that some might have expected, since that would have run counter to the theme.  The gladiator management aspects exist to feed the sense of careless brutality, not to satisfy the sage planner.  If you were expecting to slowly build your house into a thriving and respected pillar of society, look elsewhere - this is a game about a determined woman clawing her way to the blood-soaked top.\n\nEven taking the gameplay as it is, though, strictly speaking it's somewhat flawed as a game.  Training is useful, but ultimately the power of your gladiators is based pretty much entirely on winning and performing well in the arena, which makes a good swathe of the management of your gladiators very secondary, other than buying gear.  The strategy of the game is fairly simplistic and it's not hard to figure out how to crack the game over your knee in the space of half a playthrough or so.  The option to personally command gladiators might serve, somewhat, at first, but from the midgame onwards battles are dominated by AI-controlled lightning-fast gladiators exploding their enemies in a shower of gore in a series of charges almost too quick to follow with the naked eye, let alone any kind of manual control.  Fair bits of the game are poorly explained, and the real-time nature of the game means there's constant pressure to keep trying to stay afloat instead of slowing down to learn more.  There's all kinds of minor niggles here and there of that nature that keep the gameplay from being particularly deep or engrossing.\n\nIn a sense, you might say that Domina is less of a game than it is an art piece.  But it is an art piece that is very good at what it does, and it still is very firmly a decent, fun, and playable game, albeit one dominated by its artistic message.  If you want to watch a society ripping itself apart for pleasure, pick up Domina and enjoy.  If you just want to watch pixel men explode into blood fountains to a pulse-pounding beat, have a blast.  Otherwise, caveat emptor.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38283429", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523355603218078613", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1513183002, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1513130195, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076717216", "playtime_forever": 89, "last_played": 1513108481, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "The game doesn't adequately explain what your goal is until you've been playing for about an hour, so your time up until then is just kind of wandering through the menus trying out things and then BAM you're in your first fight and you don't know why. You're going to be very confused very early when you can't control your character and you don't realize that 'mind control' is actually an upgrade you have to buy from an upgrade tree that isn't very intuitive to find early on.\n\nIt is fine to have a game that recognizes the skill of the AI, and you're intended to have your gladiators be AI lots of the time and that works, but it takes away from the player's desire to hack and slash into an arena. As a result this game is more of a 'gladiator arena simulator' than a gauntlet itself.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly solid, but it feels light on content. This game has good enough controls and combat is slightly simple, but still responsive and fun. The game could benefit a lot from a multiplayer mode where players could compete in arenas with others online, as well as a sandbox mode where you can test and experiment with different types of gladiators.\n\nUntil this game gets some kind of significant update I am not going to reccommend it. For the $10 price tag it doesn't quite deliver. It is by no means terrible and if you're really interested I think you could have a lot of fun with this game, it just does not feel like a full release quite yet.\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "38270190", "weighted_vote_score": "0.476644426584243774", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1513130195, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1513129920, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103497349", "playtime_forever": 492, "last_played": 1514229025, "num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "This game has a lot of potential, but I don't think it's quite there yet.

It really does not help that there aren't save slots in the sense of saving a state and being able to go back to it any time you want to rather than just as a means of basically a checkpoint for your progress. For example when I was able to achieve victory for I guess i'll say the \"story\" event. I was then quite literally thrown into the pit as my avatar and was surrounded by 7 fighters and had only 2 slaves at my side. So basically because of some circumstances that were random or had something to do with how I was playing (my fighters were all happy and I was on good terms with both the military guy and magistrate) I was destroyed and lost probably a good hour and half of work in literally seconds because \"trial by error\" game mechanics. No thank you, that just deters me as a player knowing I can be doing the right things mechanically but because a random thing happens or an event you don't see coming the first time that is set to happen you can get frustrated by getting hoodwinked.\n\n   Frankly I get tired of being hoodwinked for the 3rd time by another event and losing hours of work. The game is very well built but the trial by error thing really makes me sour and not in a cuphead sort of frustrated way. Simply because where cuphead is just minutes of your time and you get better, this can be well over hours.

There's decent variance in the gladiators, crowd, arenas, etc. It just works really well. \n\nGameplay is flexible. You spend most of your time managing stats and upgrading your facilities/gladiators. There's a tiny bit of tedium to it, but the game manages it well and provides you with many options to automate bits and pieces. Combat can be strictly AI (my prefered way) or with an early upgrade, you can control one of your gladiators on the field.

The soundtrack is top notch and I've found myself listening to it outside the game as well. The graphical style is great and all the gear looks amazing, pixelated as it is. The characters have weird proportions tho and their limbs look odd with just one or two pixel width on them. That said the blood and weather effects are a real hoot to look at.\n\nAlso this is probably the only game on steam where you can live out your fantasies of Spartacus (the TV series or the boardgame, or both). The look and feel of this game is like straight out of the series. \n\nThen to the bad parts. At least on normal, the game is super easy. RNG might once or twice screw you over and you lose your #1 guy in a pit fight to someone critting him with a wooden dagger, but most of the time you get one guy all maxed out and he'll solo 8vs1 fights under 5 seconds.  The game runs a currency of money, wine, food and water but if your maxed out guy keeps winning you'll never run out of anything else but money (upgrading gear costs a lot if you want to keep other gladiators geared up as well).\n\nThe UI could use some work as well. While pixel graphics are what they are it doesn't have to extend to making the UI clunky. It hides some information where you'd want to know it before a fight and it's sometimes difficult to differentiate your gladiators when choosing them for a fight. Handling the jupiter cards (upgrades to gladiators) is especially wonky.\n\nHalf the professionals you can buy from the marketplace do nothing of use. The slots for assistants are limited and there's just about four that do anything half decent. Maybe the game is still in development and this will change but I can't see any reason to get a bard to block an assistant slot to raise morale when I can just toss a coin and a bottle of wine, both of which are an endless resource, at every gladiator to keep them happy. \n\nThere's a lot of gear to buy that all have distinct looks which is amazing, but the downside is 80% of the gear is priced so cheap that you'll just breeze through them to the best stuff. There's almost zero feeling of gradual progression when you have 4000 gp on you and the upgrades are somewhere in the ballpark of 5gp each.\n\nThen the worst part. The game actually has a difficult mechanic underneath but you're not told about it until the very end where you realize a mechanic earlier on that you felt was completely pointless suddenly becomes the deciding factor in whether you win or lose. There's no warning. You're just in an unwinnable situation if you didn't do a certain thing several times before. I won't spoil it but you'll see it on your first playthrough. It's super frustrating when you play a game you feel is super easy for 3 hours only to find out it was about something completely different in the end that you had no way of knowing because you weren't told. A really big blemish on an otherwise promising game.\n\nAll this said I'll still give it a recommendation. The theme is amazing, music is superb and the graphics are quite good. There's a lot of potential and if you can get this for a discount ( I paid 5 eur) the few hours you get now are worth it to support what it hopefully will become down the road.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38097666", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512547237, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512543199, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048082626", "playtime_forever": 709, "last_played": 1547129981, "num_reviews": 36, "num_games_owned": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I love management games like this.

You can chose to be a brutal mean and/or avid lanista but you don't get any reward for it, just penalty. You have several class of gladiator to unlock (three) but the one you get by default is just 15* better than the others.\n3. You can finish the game in about 1hours (the time it take for the year to pass ingame with a single gladiator without issue. I prepared myself for about a month ingame to face my first boss and killes him in two shot. Then i went to all of the other boss and this guys killed them all without healing inbetween, even doing the team matchs alone (including the very last one after the year). I wasen't in easy mode, just the medium by default difficulty.\n4. You can chose to set your gladiator's free but it's pretty useless, they ask to be freed after a certain amount of victory, but why would i set my champion free while he's been at my service for less than a year and was preparing for the championship? I'd like to see an option that benefit me like keeping him as dotore or anything that keep him with me while being free. The only people i set free are the gladiator i win (you get a ton of those) after every fight and that make my ludus over crowded, i can't even sell them, i just show my whole team of gladiator \"see? if you're useless i'll set you free instantly, if you're usefull you'll never leave\"\n5. i could go on but mostly it's the fact that there \"seem\" to be a lot of content but it's either useless or inexplored and that you basically need to worry about two to three thing maximum to finish the game.\n\nI bought it for 3.49, wasen't worth it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "38080119", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523182272911071777", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512482720, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512480965, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043199525", "playtime_forever": 197, "last_played": 1512470191, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I kicked god in the nuts.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38079563", "weighted_vote_score": "0.438271164894104004", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512480965, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"timestamp_created": 1512470055, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088758749", "playtime_forever": 1311, "last_played": 1544208632, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "<3", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38076654", "weighted_vote_score": "0.456071078777313232", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512470055, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512469317, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111553636", "playtime_forever": 2776, "last_played": 1551238906, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Almost 6 hours as of writing this, first day of playing.\n\nPretty addicting tbh", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38076479", "weighted_vote_score": "0.514145135879516602", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512469317, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512466288, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961027879", "playtime_forever": 1128, "last_played": 1519475955, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Highly recommended! \nGreat humour, fast pace. \nIt's a short game, but that means you'll complete it a few times to make sure you get to do everything.\nThe replay value is very high.\nGreat sountrack!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38075795", "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512466288, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512465395, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077860088", "playtime_forever": 388, "last_played": 1527792822, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Born a Slave, Formed into a Gladiator, Lived as a HERO!!!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38075578", "weighted_vote_score": "0.456071078777313232", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512465395, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512464037, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052249861", "playtime_forever": 317, "last_played": 1549445850, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Gave this game a bad review when it first came out due to balance issues, but it seems to be a lot better now!

Once you do that, there isn't much left to do. To get to that point, you would have had to win many of the regional games, you would likely have several level 200 characters (max) of different classes, you would have fully upgraded armor and weapons (etc). Sure you could keep playing, but when there isn't really anything else to see, what is the point?\n\nSo yes: great game, tons of fun, but I was able to \"beat\" it in a couple hours. Its actually very casual. There's not a ton of strategy involved. There is a distinct \"hump\" (getting a level 200 fully kitted gladiator with lots of special training), after which the challenge of the game drops dramatically. You can continue to use that gladiator to help train others by going into the arena with them, until they are also level 200 full-kit.\n\nThere are a couple things that this game really needs.\n[olist]\n[*] Non linear upgrade system. Right now there is an objective best kit for each class. One way to improve the strategic depth of the game would involve being able to purchase any armor/weapons, and give them various stackable bonuses to make gladiators specialized or general, depending on the style of the player.\n[*] This game REALLY needs time control in the training area. Time ticks down constantly to events, but there are only 2 time speeds: fast and paused. While I'm trying to distribute card perks to gladiators, time is ticking down, which prevents me from giving it as much thought as I would like. \n[/olist]", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "38070120", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523355603218078613", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1512441144, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1512440122, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040265218", "playtime_forever": 608, "last_played": 1515133429, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I would like to ask for just One thing.

But also, it's not hard enough. At the end of my game I had maxed out six gladiators and had the other two pretty close to maxed out. I thought I would lose since their equipment had never been repaired, but no, I still won. That said, it is an ok game still if you're into that, but it won't hold you for long  as of right now. This game is still in beta though and has huge potential.\n\n\nWhat I like \n-cool theme and concept\n-cool effects\n-it's nice to train up a bunch of gladiators\n-the cards are nice\n-lots of updates\n\nWhat I think the devs should improve, and this is while it's still in beta, so I hope they can take some of these suggestions, and some of these things they probably already do know. \n\n-replayability: I played it once on endless mode, and then in career mode and that was stretching it \n-formula: it felt too formulaic to me. Like, I'd first hire a builder to build up my training equipment, an educator, and a healer. Later I got rid of the builder after the training equipment was all done, and then replaced him with a blacksmith. I'd have tons of exhibition matches, later I'd fire my gladiators who didn't make it to 200 or close to it, and buy better ones from the legate.  Most of them were Thrax. Max out my training as fast as I could, use cards. Easy peasy. I'll probably do this every game if I ever play it again. \n\nThe thing about this game right now that really is a peeve, is that there is so much that is useless, and there's so much with potential.\n\nAs of now, \na) there's no reason to use anything other than thrax with high agility. An army of those is especially unstoppable. \nb) there's no reason for a blacksmith if you're playing career. \nc) there's no advantages in taking slaves and building them up from nothing, I'd just set them free and buy better gladiators from the legate. \nd) there's no reason for any other employees other than medic, educator, blacksmith and partially the architect. I'd like to use the others as well, because they have interesting abilities, but it's just not practical in the long run.\ne) there's almost nothing to the story (I'd really dig it if there were more we could know about the protagonist, make more personal choices, etc). Does she have friends? Is she single? What are her other ambitions? What does she like? She doesn't feel like a person. I wish there were more you could do as her. And I know there is a little bit, but some more fleshing out of her character would be great. It doesn't feel like she's doing anything. \nf) the economy is too easy. Supplies are too cheap for me to build a vineyard. I don't care to build a well or anything, water is 2gp and you make upwards of like 700gp from winning a fight. It has no impact on the game for me to get that upgrade. Especially in late-game.\n\n\n\nAnother couple of things\n\nAdditionally, this is really more of a personal suggestion, and it has no bearing on my rating, but I really would dig it if the protagonist was a male, or if we could choose between a male and female. Another thing I thought would have been great is to flesh out the world outside. To me it's all just clicks, and no real experience of doing anything. I mean, there is a little bit, but it's not really enough to feel like a real world. Are there other rivals? What other challenges are there to be overcome than just arena fights? I get you can just improve relations with wine, but what about familial relations? Maybe it's the type of person I am, where I don't like things without a type of experience or meaning, but I know for a fact that that would improve the game 100%, so that you would feel as if you were inside that world.

I'd recommend it as is if you can pick it up for $3 or something. This does provide the sensation of running a gladiator school in Rome, and there aren't any games out there that really do a good job of that. So if you really want a game where you run a gladiator school, this title is as good as any but it won't make you as happy as you'd expect.\n\nThe problem with Domina is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.\n\nIf you play it as a management sim, you get this:\n\nYou can develop your gladiators and improve your school - that stuff is cool. But the world has no sense of depth. It's got this arbitrary goal where you're supposed to beat all of the regional champions by the end of the year. AI opponents are randomly generated and you don't have different fights to pick from - so you can either fight whatever match the AI decides you're going to fight, or take a reputation hit. Some of the fights are ridiculous like 3 on 1 against. And if you take the reputation hit, you're more likely to get a crappy fight the next time, too.\n\nLevel scaling. So since you have a time limit, and the only way you can earn money is to win fights, you put your best fighter out there as often as you can. And because you win, the randomly generated opponents get stronger. This means that unless you use your best one or two fighters every time, you're going to get stomped. As long as your best fighter keeps winning, he'll get insanely strong and knock down 9 opponents in 2 seconds. But if that guy gets killed, then what? You've got a bunch of scrubs against AI that's been scaled to fight your best guy, and if you can't win, you can't earn money.\n\nReally lame random events. No, seriously. \n\n\"Your gladiator gets bitten by a snake. The gladiator dies.\"\n\n\"Your gladiator is suffering from sunstroke. What do you do?\n- Leave him out to practice in the blazing sun\n- Bring him inside to rest in the shade\"\n\nBring him inside to rest.\n\n\"You bring him inside to rest. He dies.\"\n\nThen you get random stuff that requires reflexes. If your fighter surrenders, you save him by clicking as fast as you can on the mouse and keyboard. The amount of time you have to click is random - sometimes you can't save him no matter how fast you click.\n\nIf you play it as an arcady game (you can play as your fighters):\n\nThe control scheme is really bad - no controller support and things move pretty fast.\n\nIf the dev had done away with the action stuff and focused on management depth, this game would be great. If he'd done the opposite, it probably would have been good too. But as is, the game doesn't do either strategy or action well and I don't see how it can be salvaged into a really memorable title. \n\nI've noticed the forums aren't too lively either, which usually means a game is close to being abandoned.\n\nLike I said, get it if it's $3-4.

It's janky in areas. The tutorial for example has an option to start it, but doesn't actually exist, and picking its option limits your play options in normal pprogression because it's just that broken. \n\nBut it doesn't matter much. The gameplay is simple enough to pick up as it is. There's a gameflow and a lot of little hidden mechanics that get you to run through the year of gladiator school management you do in the game. It's all about a confluence of many different simple systems interacting. \n\nFor the most part it works. And playing a management game with a short cycle you can win in a day is actually a very nice change of pace in a way. But I do hope for more depth too. Not more new systems, just expansions in the ones that currently exist, like the combat flow of the fights themselves, and AI in them and all that. \n\nBut still, it's fun and worth the time.

Two or three playthroughs should be enough to complete successfully.\n\n[h1]Comparison[/h1]\nThe setting is quite original. \nIn terms of gameplay similar to Punch Club with some aspects reminding me of FTL.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nYou are a female domina in charge of your ludus. You have to buy slaves and train them to become ruthless gladiators who will bring you fame and glory in the arena.\n\n[b]WARNING: SOME MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD![/b]\n\n[spoiler]After the final battle you are betrayed and as a defenceless woman you are thrown in the arena yourself to fight a group of opponents. There is absolutely no way for you to win that fight on your own. The only way to win is to grant freedom to a bunch of your gladiators back when you were still in charge. Then they will come to your aid at the time of need. But you are never told that in the game. Sure, there is the option to grant freedom, but when you trained a killer gladiator who wins every fight, you don't think about getting rid of them.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]SPOILERS OVER![/b]\n\n[h1]Look...[/h1]\nIt has some very nice, pixel-art graphics. The thing I liked the most was the blood spatter in the arena. \n\n[h1]... and Feel[/h1]\nThings are not explained well enough. That's my main problem with this game. You go to the Options menu and you see there are key bindings to control your gladiator in the arena. So the fight begins, you try to move, but you can't and AI is in control of your fighter. I googled it straight away and it turns out that you need to develop the Mind Control ability to actually control your warriors. I wish that was explained somewhere in the game, without having to read the descriptions of all the abilities before you start playing.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nIt's actually pretty good! It has nice and calm moments that match the game setting and atmosphere. And it can quickly turn into dynamic music that fits perfectly with arena battles. You can check out the whole thing on [url=https://bignic.bandcamp.com/album/domina]bignic's Band Camp page[/url].\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt's resource management, mostly. You need to control your money, food, water and wine, while trying to expand and improve your ludus. Have your gladiators train on improving their stats and equip them with better weapons and armours. In the meantime your doctore will unlock new moves and skills for your fighters. You can also hire other specialists who will reduce training or healing times.\nYou have one year to get your gladiators ready for a big tournament. There are some regular fights that you can fight in, but you can also arrange additional ones or challenge arena legends in different areas of the map.\nEach victory will grant you more money, improved skills for the winners, potential new gladiators or improvement cards (Jupiter's Blessings) that you can use on your fighters or other employees to make them more efficient.\nThe fights in the arena are usually random. It's one or more of your gladiators against one or more enemies, often chained to the ground or supported by lions. You can control one of your fighters (after you unlock a skill) or have AI do that for you (the AI abilities can be improved with meditation training) - this is necessary during many vs many battles.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's short and not that complicated, but still not explained well enough.\nI just wanted to play one more battle and I ended up finishing the game in one sitting. \nBut I don't feel like playing again.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- nice pixel-art graphics\n- great soundtrack\n- short and fun while it lasts\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- some bits are not explained well enough\n- disappointing ending\n- fighting manually can be difficult with low level gladiators\n\n\n[quote][i]For more reviews, follow my Curator page[/i] - [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31210849-Sublime-Dent/]Sublime Dent[/url][/b].[/quote]", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "36489778", "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1527592982, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1510544850, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031789432", "playtime_forever": 171, "last_played": 1510544729, "num_reviews": 169, "num_games_owned": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Seemed easy, then it had a twist.

I played it 3 times just to see if I missed the point of the game.\nOn the 3rd playthrough I found out that there is a mechanic where gladiators can escape if their morale is too low apparently? But keeping your gladiators morale almost fully up does not require ANYTHING.\nSo why would they escape, or why would you give them coin or wine (which does not alter thir morale) or why would you invest in a Private Room for your top mutant is beyond me.\n\nI noticed a slight Papers Please theme with \"moral choices\" and reprecussions.\nHowever it is unclear which actions have reprecussions and even if they actually do have any reprecusions at all.\nThe \"moral choices\" are extremely shallow and lack any motivation to do the \"right\" thing.\n\nAll in all, this game has some interesting mechanics but utterly lacks any motivation to use any of them, simply because you breeze through the entire game with your super mutant. In order for the game mechanics to be functional, you need to create the need for the player to use them.\nI'm still pondering whether the game is just broken or simply (as it is the standard for indie devs) too early in development to be released to the public.\n\nI wouldn't value this game at EUR 10. But I played through it 3 times, so I'm not going to ask for a refund.\nHowever, it is a fun little mindless mobile time waster with good repetitive music and your usual pixelated art-style.\n\nEDIT 2: Just found out there are chariots... apparently.... somewhere in the game?

Brutal fights, lots of funny dialogue and cool music! Speaking of Brutal, my best Gladiator was Brutus from Syria who was far and beyond all my other Gladiators. Brutus began as second fiddle to Ciro from Naples and Nonius of Germania. Ciro was surprisingly killed in a 1v4 battle after remaining stuck on his chain. Nonius perished because he won a series of fights and we showered him with wine as a reward and he choked on his own vomit. Brutus on the other hand won 26 matches on his path to glory and did not vomit once.\n\nAll I have to say is the developer of this game should really slow down the speed of fights as they are way too fast. An option to slow down fights would be great. There is an option for slower fights (dull blades) but we didn't see much of a difference. Sometimes it's just too hard to see who is who during those messy battles.\n\nI would like to see more gear and to top it off if a gladiator dies in your ludas, you should be able to give his gear to someone else.\n\nOther than that it's an amazingly fun game and looks beautifull as pixel graphics.\n\nI give this 9/10.

Once I had a few gladiators who were killin' it (pun intended), the game was pretty fun! There were several victories where I fist pumped and basically congradulated my winning gladiator out loud. It was satisfying to watch my most experienced fighters slaughter the opposition after months and months of riskier bouts, intensive training, and expensive equipment purchases.\n\nHowever, every combat was extremely fast and chaotic. I'd say I had zero idea what was happening ~80% of the time. That was disappointing.\n\nI played through the main story in 2 hours.

I guess I didn't technically dig into all the depth that exists in the stats and employees and intrigue, etc. But I'm not really interested.

I've only just picked up the game the other day and currently only have 9 hours into the game.  A few bullet points that I've procured that I'd like to mention.\n\n1.) Graphics are very nice.  Yes, it returns to the pixel roots of games of old, and it is well executed. There are tiny little detals that are implimated (ex the hanging moss swaying in the breeze in the training area).  When gore mode is allowed, the blood splatter, limbs and heads being lopped off is well done.\n\n2.) The music for the game is by far some of the best music that I've heard with in games in a long time.  I'd be willing to go as far as to say it's up there with one of my other favorite games, Wolfenstien TNO.\n\n3.) The Twitch intergration is a awesome feature.  I personally don't stream, but a few streamers that I follow have streamed Domina and I love how the watchers of the stream actually can act like the crowds of the arena in the old days and can choose life or death for a gladiator.\n\n4.) Piggy backing off of the last note, the one thing that I personally don't like is when you are playing single player, and you get the meter that you have to click spam to try to spare your gladiator.  This is being addressed on the forums however currently at the time of penning this review, and the Dev has stated that they are looking into fixing this feature.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth every penny.

Domina is mostly a management game than a fighter, but it manages to be enjoyable being both.\n\nIt takes a matter of seconds to start your journey, you're presented to your ludus, 3 starting gladiators and there you go. From now on it's your responsibility to train them, please the Legate and the Magistrate, hire up to 3 employees for your ludus and make sure resources aren't missing. The game isn't too overly complicated with what you have to do, which I enjoyed. It's easy to learn and not that hard to master, within a few battles and maybe some unwanted deaths, you'll start to rise and become the best lanista the Romans have ever seen!\n\nYou have exactly one year to train your gladiators until they are ready for the final games, hosted by The Emperor himself. Purchase slaves or already trained gladiators, upgrade their skills and equipment and keep their mood up high. When men are upset, they will ask for their freedom, and for a lanista, freedom is expensive. The skill tree is a set of abilities taught by the Doctore, while being a huge monetary investment, the improvements on the gladiators are drastically needed.\n\nOne of these skills is Mind Control, which is where the player steps in. This gives you the ability to control your gladiator and fight on the arenas yourself. The controls and gameplay are fairly simple but it surely feels good to decapitate someone with your overpowered fighter. In the midst of these upgrades, two of them include brand new fighting styles (or classes) for your servants. The default is always the Thraex - standard shield and sword fighting. Then we have Murmillo and Retiarius! The first is a dual-wielding making the shield absent. The latter uses long weapons, a shield and a net. When the 2 skills are explored through the Doctore, you can train your gladiators with whatever style you like the most.\n\nThroughout of these 365 days of surviving assassination attempts, facing regional champions, behemoths and even lions, there's random events that can be outright funny, benefit you or really damage your progress. They're presented as text with multiple choices. These usually are connected to your relations with the Legate and the Magistrate. Displeasing these two isn't that wise of a move since they organize most of your fights.\n\nPersonally, I thought Domina was great. It's well-thought and simple, but it may punish you when you're reckless. It's all about learning what to and what not to do, and make your mistakes serve as lessons for your next battles. Believe me, you won't want to cover up a plan to assassinate the Magistrate... Believe me.

Unfortunately this game is lacking in replayability once you do a few playthroughs and end up getting your own champion with max stats. I haven't tried it on a higher difficulty so that could allow for some replayability.\n\nHere's where I think this game could improve:\n- Workshop/modding support so people can add more gladiator classes, weapons/armour/etc., employees, maps, music, and whatever else you could imagine. If workshop/modding were added that would definitely draw me back to playing this game.\n- Specializations for each gladiator class with different sub-sets of weapons/armour/etc. For example, having a gladiator specialize in speed (lighter equipment, lower damage, faster attacks), strength (heavy equipment, high damage, slower attacks), balanced (best of both worlds).\n- More variety with music/random events/battles. After awhile everything starts to repeat quite a lot. When I say battles I'd like to see more obstacles and challanges. For example the arena could have different layouts (mazes, booby traps, etc.) allied gladiators could be chained to each other so that they can't move far apart, it'd also be nice to see more exotic animals in the arena.\n- More gladiator classes. I think adding workshop/modding support is the best way to address this, but if that's not possible then simply seeing more classes would be great.\n- Controller suport to control your gladiator.\n- Multiplayer. I can see this one as a difficult one to address. Do you select a gladiator to use from your own ludus? Do you customize your own gladiator in a menu before going in to battle? Do you just get a random gladiator? What gamemodes do you have (e.g. to the death in 1v1/2v2/4v4, free for all with unlimited repsawns, etc.)?\n\nThose are the main improvements I foresee that could really spice up the game. Extra cool things to see would be stuff like viewing your competitor's ludus, an expanded Doctore research tree, and more political options to influence how arena battles are set up (e.g. bribing the magistrate to tilt the odds in your favour).

Don't thank me, it's all due to my romanian friends. Also we need more game like this, more polished if possible.\n\nFor long review you can scrool down, lemme list few things for express one,\n+A good game for few hours, price/content wise it's worth it.\n+Sounds and sountracks are really well made.\n+It's battle and management system is admirable.\n\n-Repative after few hours,\n-Endless mode has several game breaking bugs,\n-Endless mode also got tons of bugs which will annoy you till death\n-It needs more content and polisment for more stabil and enjoyable experience. \n\nLong review below;\n\nDomina is a good game, not great but by all means not bad either. When you started to game it floods you with tons of things like training slaves, their needs, their skills, blessings, random events, host's moods, pit fights, morales, daily consumptions etc. etc. But tutorial and tips (info) system is really good, so don't be afraid for new things. Honestly first few hours you will be mesmerized to learn all the things and try to survive in this harsh atmosphare. You will train a champion which you spend tons of time and money and in the end you will lose him. Either he will die while trying to claim glory in arena or he will just run away with a slave girl at night. Alas show will go on. \n\nHowever, after few hours later you will learn tips and tricks. Then game will became lots of easier and repative, if you manage to cyle your gladiator's training before your champion's retirement or death it will became an easy game without a charm. Especially in endless mode you will be bored to death after 2-3 cycle of championship. \n\nAlso unfortunetly endless mode got some serious game breaking bugs.

Most of the game is kinda a time/resource management minigame where you try and make sure your Gladiators are well equipped, are given the proper support and facilities, and are ready for the challenges at hand.\n\nDuring the figthing matches (that occur peridically with random conditions and fighters) you have to deal with fast paced combat that's well complemented by the intense and catchy sound track. You can choose to control the gladiator manually, or have the computer do it, though on team games any gladiator past the first one you pick is going to be AI guided (for better or for worse).\n\nIf I were to summarize this game with a reference to another, I'd say its like \"Swords and Sandals 2, but more intense\". If any of you played that flash game you'll know what I'm talking about, though rather than turn based this game is real time, so you have to act fast as most matches last under 30 seconds.\n\nAlso while your playing the time/resource management game in the Ludus you'll be given random events to deal with from the two vying political figures in youre area, the aristrocratic Magistrate, and the more military focused Legate. The descriptions are like something out of the show \"Spartacus\" and if you like kinda that dark humor with a bit of gritty realism you'll really love those scenarios (though you'll start to see repeats if you play the game a few times).\n\nI'd say Domina's only downside is the random nature of the encounters, you can be up against one gladiator that could barely hold his own against one of your contentors or in some cases you can be up against an entire team of well armed opponents that can tear even your champions to shreds. The trick is to know when to throw your weaker contestants in knowing they're going to lose so you can save your best gladiators for the matches where you have a better chance at success.\n\nAnyway, if you like time/resource management games with some combat inbetween you'll love this game; the sound track in particular will get you hyped with every match and if your anything like me you'll be rocking your head to the beat as the awesome music transitions in during the preliminary match countdown.

The end goal is to win the grand tournament, with NPC customization and politics on the way. \n\nThe largest issue I see with the game is that once you have a powerhouse gladiator, it almost forces you to use him exclusively. The level and matching could use some work, so that other fighters get a chance to level up, and so that when I send \"Justinian the Godslayer\" into battle with 8 of his comrades, he's not the only survivor every time. It was more efficient to send him in alone VS 10 other gladiators. \n\nOtherwise the game is definitely worth the buy and the time and you'll have a lot of fun with it. \n\nLastly, and I saved the best for last, the music is SICK.

There is a disappointing lack of depth in the strategy. More than making decisions most mechanics are just like a clickfest. This is mostly related with how meaningless are a lot of options, how easy is to get to a win strategy, (having an overpowered guy, in fact that is the only approach that seems to work), and so on\u2026\n\nThe worse problem is the balance, and in particular how the enemies escalate, always forcing you to use your best guy and making impossible to train the rest of your gladiators. At the same time, the game wants you to free your best gladiators without giving you any information of how can you win at all if you do so (maybe the difficult of the enemies is reduced accordingly, but it is never hinted)\n\nThe way the game levels your enemies kind of seems that is related with the number of won fights, and all fights follow this rule. The enemies seem to have a level slightly inferior to your total number of victories, pushing you to use only one or two fighters each time or just losing. You feel like you fight against game mechanics instead of the arena and that is a very bad feeling.\n\nAlso the game still needs some graphic additions in the facilities and variety in the events\n\n- Why not having the option to select your fighters first in some fights so the IA choses theirs accordingly? \n- Why training is so meaningless compared with fighting experience? (You rely only on use your experienced gladiators in all the fights so none of the new recruits can ever win experience in a vicious circle).\n- Why not to punish with less public favor and experience if you fight against weaker fighters? \n- Why not making different the exhibitions or the pits from the arena? (For example only low level fighters in some of them, non-lethal exhibitions or facing some variety besides the background)\n- Why it is pointless to use strategies of combining different classes in different ways for different enemies? \n- Why there is no decision regarding the abilities you can choose? (You just kind of unlock everything with no decision making)\n- Why the classes are only unlocked late in the game, so you will never have experienced fighters in any but the initial class?\n- Why not making more meaningful the class and abilities in a tactical way? \n- Why not favoring having a strong set of gladiators instead of a single one? \n- Why not adding variety in the fights (such as tying to fighters in different parts of the arena, or adding more environmental resources like traps, fire... also chariots please do chariots)? \n- Why letting the player go against the bosses anytime he wants so they eventually become easier fights than the regular ones (the bosses do not increase difficulty)?\n- Why not making the political and resource management meaningful in some way?\n- Why there is no relevant management of personnel, instead of having very useful and very useless options?\n- Why there is so many mechanics that seem totally pointless? \n- Why there is a wave fighting at all? (You always want to avoid these fights since you will likely lose the gladiators who fight first unless you have a god gladiator who destroys them all, making it meaningless anyway).\n- ...\n\nI liked several things from the game.

Maybe I was just extremely lucky, I'm not sure.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this, in truth. It's well made, but there is one, rather fatal, flaw: It seems to be really easy to make an absolute god.\n\nThis was during my second attempt at the game - the first one failed pretty miserably. But not long into my second attempt, one specific character pretty much became god in the arena. I don't know if it was a mix of the right Jupiter cards or something to make it possible, but he became completely, game-breakingly untouchable, and eventually raised to 200 in EVERY stat. I don't think past the last maybe 150 days left of the game he took a single point of damage. He absolutely trampled every single tournament fight, and in the last fight he didn't take a single point of damage either, and he cut down the whole group of enemies in about three swings, several of them died at once. I should mention that this was also at the highest difficulty setting.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love a good twelve-year-old's wet dream power fantasy as much as the next guy, but the loss of challenge sucked a lot of fun out of the game. It got old fast. I would say to wait for a sale before buying this, as I was able to beat it without challenge in 3 hours' time. Probably not worth the pricetag.\n\nHOWEVER, with that said, it is very unique, I don't think I've seen anything like it. But it's not as good as it could be, because things get convoluted very fast with the amount of slaves you can amass, and, on top of that, most of them won't even see battle, because they can't train skills nearly as fast as fights come out, and the difficulty will usually try to top the previous fight, which means that there's an exponential increase of difficulty compared to some slaves' skills, effectively making them little more than fodder. Which is a strategy in itself, granted, but it'll mean that there's a massive skill gap between your champion and all the others.

Don't expect to have one or two epic gladiators. You really need 8 to 10 decent guys. Don't take every fight on. Save your money. Bet on side fights. Plan to play a few games before you feel confident. Experiment with everything.

But.. I think the game is [i]so close[/i] to being [i]so much[/i] better. Domina just needs a few balance changes, and the replay value of this game would skyrocket.

He completely carried all the other fighters who sometimes would just run away because they were vastly underpowered against the competition.\n\nMy wrecking ball would simply two-shot every enemy he faced without hesitation. The point of this though, is that it's not a fluke. This is how the game is balanced to work. You can tell from multiple playthroughs that this is the best path. It's too easy for one character to snowball, and then when that happens and the enemies scale, your other fighters are too weak to survive, and so you essentially have one demigod, and a bunch of cannon fodder.\n\nI love playing Domina! I've never PogChamp'd so hard during a game. However, something about it doesn't feel right.\n\nThe appropriate changes would be something like: It's easier to catch other gladiators up to your big men, and your big men don't spiral out of control into unstoppable monsters. Also, the food, and water management is too easy and simple, and there really are no doubts about who you should hire for your ludus. Once you've played the game a single playthrough you know that there are 3 very easy best options, and 6 or so useless ones.\n\nAll in all, a very entertaining game!

I'm okay with learning as I go, but I'm seeing a lot of features where I have no idea if or when they're going to become relevant, because they seem pointless now. For example, there's this whol political side mechanic, where you have competing favor with a Magistrate and a Legate, but they're both pretty useless, since they're just a source of slaves, which you get too many for winning fights anyways. \n\nA lot of the mechanics seem shallow or tedious. Researching basically everything happens in real time, but there's no reason to leave anyone idle, so you're punished for not clicking on everyone at the right time. Training gladiators in general is tedious, and it's really hard to percieve the impact it's having most of the time. Keeping your gladiators straight is a chore. You end up just having the 1 or 2 good ones and a bunch of filler slaves. Then there's a dumb button mash minigame to save  your fighters' lives. It's out of place.\n\nThe big problem is that I'm not even sure if I'm doing anything wrong. I don't feel like I \"get\" the game, but I don't feel like I'm learning quickly. I hope there's more to the game than I've figured out so far, but so far I wasn't compelled to finish the first \"year,\" which I gather is the arbitrary \"end\" I'm supposed to care about.\n\nThe art is awesome. I love it, but you can see everything you need to see in the screenshots, to know whether it's your thing or not. It can sometimes be hard to keep track of your gladiator even during 1 on 1 fights, but I'll forgive that for the clean grittiness of the combat presentation.\n\nThe music is a little weird. It's a pretty intense techno-rock soundtrack, which simultaneously feels a little jarring and kinda cool and unique. I don't know.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but the management feels shallow, tedious, and arbitrary, and the political stuff seems completely illusory.

Despite this, the charm does die when the games forray into procedurally generated text within the maps of the gladiatoral \"boss\" challenges fail to make sense or are gramatically incorrect. However, this would be the only downside to the game, so far.

Not going to recommend waiting for a sale, not going to recommend waiting for someone to buy it for you. I recommend you buy it now. Been playing it for a decent amount of time, and I feel I can honestly say this game deserves more attention, especially if you stream on Twitch. \n\nThe best way to describe this game is a gladiatorial management game with optional player controlled combat. Let's go over the pros and cons.\n\nPros;\n1. The game caters to both hardcore and casual players. If you only have 5 minutes to play here and there, you can do some management of your team, buy some equipment, and get in a battle or two. If you just got home from work and want to raise some deadly warriors unrivalled by all over a few hours, you can do that as well.\n2. The music is phenomenal! The musical score is rich, catchy, and really well integrated into gameplay. It can get a little repetitive if you just sit on a screen typing a review, but once you get past that and go into battle, the music times itself to explode when the action begins. Definitely makes the combat exciting.\n3. Optional manual control of the gladiators. You can just sit back and grab some popcorn to see the AI struggle against the enemy, or decapitate them with ease. If that's not your style, and you really just want to slice and dice some man potatoes into curly fries, then pick your champion when you enter. You can switch to someone else if you want the AI to control your current guy.\n4. The combat scales well to challenge you as you advance in the timeline. There are times where you look at your proposed opponents and just know it means suicide sending your team in. Luckily, the game does give you the option to be a coward. Or you can just toss a guy in and hope for the best with the AI in control, or try to out-play the enemy with manual control.\n5. Integrated Twitch functions. This game can link to your Twitch account and give you varying benefits (or downsides if your chat is cruel). It can grab names from your viewers and place them in the game as either your recruits, or the opposing forces. The chat has the option to cheer or boo for you, and this directly affects your gold income. Optional subscriber mode only, thankfully!\n\nCons;\n1. There was only one bug I ran into so far, and it was a bit of a time waster. Had to wait a few minutes for combat to end due to a gladiator getting stuck. The devs are aware of it, and communicate with the community. So that is kind of a pro and a con.\n2. As mentioned above, the music does get a little repetitive. As awesome as it is, you may end up using your own music later on. No matter how amazing something is, it is always a little less than great after the hundredth time experiencing it.\n3. There are some slight balance issues with special items you can get in the game. While it is completely randomized, you will know it when you see it. Can't say more without spoiling some of the story.\n4. You will quickly find out that you just don't have enough space for all the men and employees you want to hire. I know it is designed to make you choose who to keep and who to get rid of, but the hoarder in me cries every time I have to ditch a good/great base gladiator because my others are well trained.\n5. The graphics are simplistic. Sometimes a little too pixelated for my taste. They still do well with what they have, though I wouldn't have minded just a tiny bit more detail.\n\nTL;DR - Overall, this game is a solid 8/10. Great music, but a little repetitive. Pixelated graphics may be a bit of a turn-off, but it makes up for it with exceptional action and entertainment. Optional manual control or pure management style of play. Twitch integration, for better or for worse.

For that reason, I figure it\u2019s time to get this review out there and let everyone know that this is great game that is truly a bright spot in the universe of low-cost indie games.\n\nDomina puts you in the role of an ancient Roman gladiator owner/manager.  The bits of story that define this are limited, but the gist of it is that you inherited your home and training grounds from your father.  You spend the majority of the game purchasing or receiving gladiators (or those to be trained as gladiators), training them in various ways, equipping them with gear, and overall just managing their ability to go out and win tournaments against other gladiators.  These fights, for the most part, take place without any direct intervention from the player.  However, early on you are able to get an ability called \u201cMind Control\u201d that makes it possible to control one gladiator that you choose.  This can be handy as there are plenty of one versus one gladiator events, but I found that the fighting was extremely fast and it seemed to me like the AI-controlled fighters could do better than me.  With practice though, I could see players taking advantage of the option and being more successful.  I also found that it was nice to just sort of sit back and watch these events like a true spectator, cheering on your gladiator.  \n\nThe conflict, outside of the arena fights themselves, comes from making the best use of your resources to get effective gladiators that can win the fights in which they participate.  You hire certain staff to aid in training in different ways, whether it\u2019s someone upgrading and adding to you facility, healing gladiators between fights, or crafting and repairing armor.  You also will encounter a variety of events involving the city around you and the two NPC counterparts involved in the operation, the Magistrate and the Legate.  These two serve not only to provide extra conflict, but can perform services like allowing you to purchase more men or arrange fights.  The balance of all of these factors creates a somewhat hectic, but very entertaining experience that, when you boil it down is essentially just a management game.\n\nFor me, one of the strong points for the game is the Twitch integration.  This puts a bot in your channel that lets players in the channel vote for the outcome some of the in-game multi-choice events and even whether surrendering gladiators live or die.  On top of that, each person in chat gets their name put in game and can make for some hilarious interactions.  It\u2019s easily one of the most fun games I\u2019ve streamed, even when only a handful of people are in the channel.  The entire process was so quick and easy to set up I almost thought I had done something wrong and missed some steps.  Streaming Domina is one of the reasons I plan to keep playing this game beyond the time frame of an average single player indie game.\n\nGenerally, I try to avoid getting too far in to graphics and sound because of the subjectivity of the matter, but when something stands out to me, I have to mention it.  The music of Domina is exceptional.  Normally, indie games have mediocre music at best and at worst you\u2019ll hear something really annoying or copyright free, but Domina\u2019s entire soundtrack is top notch.  You\u2019ll hear some strong synth beat industrial stuff backed with some great melodic touches from strings at times and others will feature much more ambient trance-like songs that really give you an almost unwelcome feeling of desperation as you try to make your way to the end of the game.  This soundtrack rates at or near the very top of indie game soundtracks for me.  Right up there classics like Bastion and Braid.  It\u2019s almost worth buying the game just to hear the soundtrack, though it is available separately for purchase (assuming you don\u2019t just want to listen to it on youtube).  \n\nIf there\u2019s any one issue I could pinpoint with Domina, it\u2019s that the combat events seem to be a little bit more randomized than I would like.  You have events coming in after a certain amount of time (measured with in game \u201cdays\u201d) and they randomize among a collection of different situations where you may win with virtually no challenge or be completely slaughtered.  For instance, you may have the opportunity to place several gladiators against one which is usually a slaughter, while other times you may have to toss in half a dozen or more in a big group fight that could wipe out your whole squad.   It can be frustrating to lose some of your best-trained people to what feels like RNG.  You can always reject these battles and move on gaining nothing, but that can still be bad for your overall progression as you miss an opportunity to gain more resources and better train your team.\n\nDomina is one of those games you can\u2019t really judge by what the trailers try to convey.  You won\u2019t see the bulk of the game because, in practice, it's watching people dance around training while you manage the process of keeping them alive and working at their peak efficiency.  I suppose to some degree there may be people that don\u2019t find the concept appealing, but for me, along with the many other quality aspects I\u2019ve mentioned, I have a hard time putting it down.

That fighter, in my experience, then always asks to be released three times and escapes without any way to stop him. This game is very frustrating and it seems that there is no strategy that can guarantee success or even make it any more likely than failure. \n\nI must admit that the aspect of the game that provides you with some chance to use your skill to win, the ability to control your fighters, was neglected on my part. I tried it briefly and only won one out of these four fights. The controls seemed hard to use and I feel that even if I did master them, I could still have sent my gladiator in to a pit fight or match which he was doomed to lose because the other fighter had ridiculous stats and one shots him.

Those five hours included about six starts, and seeing it through to the end on two occasions.\n\nIt's also \u00a36.99, fully priced.\n\nIt isn't particularly complicated, although it has a lot of nice touches. It feels well put-together, and has the capacity to be extremely satisfying and head in hands frustrating when things go wrong.

I would quite cheerfully recommend it as a basic and fun strategy game with RPG elements for anyone looking for one evening's worth of fun.\n\nWhether or not \u00a36.99 represents value for money for that is at the individual's discretion. There are flash games out there for free online which have a greater lifespan. When I was playing Domina, two other games immediately sprang to mind - FTL (when does FTL NOT spring to mind?) and Punch Club. When I think of FTL I wonder if, had the developers been more ambitious and encouraged multiple playthroughs and more distinct challenges and restrictions, Domina could have been much more than it is. Yet I'm also mindful that it is not Punch Club, an enjoyable 8 hour game stretched painfully over something like 30 hours to its absolute detriment, and that is a good thing.

You run a ludus (gladiator villa), building up a fleet of sweaty pixelated meat puppets that you can toss into battles, which are bloody spectacles of gore and awesomeness. You can control one gladiator yourself (with a skill unlocked), but as a Tycoon fan, I tend to let the computer do that and focus on the management aspects.\n\nThe game is more depthful than it seems... while it lasts, that is. Training your gladiators, improving your ludus, training and managing your staff, managing resources (coin, food, water, and wine), and engaging in occasional multiple-choice scenarios will keep you busy, but not obnoxiously so. Along the way, you can fight in regularly-scheduled battles, toss your whinier gladiators into \"the pit\" (as seen on the TV show \"Spartacus\"), engage in special regional tournaments, and then play in a big end-of-the-year tournament in Rome.\n\nAs fun as this game is, it does have a few faults, which I really hope the devs will fix. The first of course is it's insanely short gameplay in regular mode: the story mode can be beaten in something like two or three hours and it's very unsatisfying. The game has an endless mode, which allows you to redo the tournament yearly, but I feel like that mode is \"hollow\" sort of and needs a bit more tycoon meat on the bone.\n\nI'd like to see my best fighters earn popularity. If I have a guy with maxed-out skills and 900 HP with 30 victories under his belt (release slaves? Never!), he should be super famous with the audience chanting his name and stuff (even if it's just in text form), and special encounters/ events should occur involving that fame, and managing ego.\n\nAfter you've played through the tournament twice in endless mode, you'll be swimming in dough, and I'd like to have some loftier end-game things to spend my coin on. Buying a farm so I no longer need to worry about the grindy experience of buying it constantly, setting up my own tournaments and inviting other Ludus' to fight, etc.\n\nA MASSIVE gear expansion is needed, too, with occasional gear rewards for fights, including special gear! Green, blue, grape, and gold/ legendary gear might be rewarded after fights, or could be bought from special vendors who occasional visit your ludus. This gear improves your stats and gives a little variety to the equipping of your gladiators.\n\nLast but not least, multiplayer! I'm sure I can't be the only person who would love fighting online, with each player being their own gladiator and improving their gear and such. That may be the loftiest thing on this list but I would love to be able to battle others online and progress my gladiator through fighting in manual-control-only bouts.\n\nSuggestions aside, this is a really fun game, and I highly recommend it if you're into tycoon games, especially if you dig the Roman vibe, pixel art, and jokes about kicking dudes in their scrotius ouchicus.

This awesome attention to audio alone is enough for me to follow your studio because so few games get that type of thing right. *roman applause*\n\nReview\n-------------\nPros: \n\u2022 Excellent art style and effects\n\u2022 Snappy menus\n\u2022 Sublime music running from industrial/tech action to atospheric ambience\n\u2022 You'll learn how to not suck quite so much after one playthrough when skipping the tutorial\n\u2022 You'll name a gladiator something like GUNDERKILL and you'll find yourself hopping out of your chair going FUCK YEAH GUNDERKILL!!! as he one shot beheads some fool \"renowned warrior\" who knew not of GUNDERKILL. You get those moments and equal ones of (in game relevant) dissapointment a lot. \n\u2022 It makes you feel coniving and controling and ruthless and merciful all at once in the best way\n\u2022 It makes you understand that people under your care food and water to live, which is objectively good in terms of educating real world dictators.  \n\nCons:\n\u2022 The absolute biggest con is that everything naturally leads to buffing one gladiator to hell and back. You can barely even get a second one going with more than 4 or 5 victories to their name, if you try to level two, one is going to get cut down and then you'll be left with a weaker main...who will probably get cut down.  Moreover your main becomes pretty unstoppable every time.  Even more moreover (SPOILERS PAST HERE) unless you release your main right before the championship (which pretty ensures your glads will lose) you're not going to survive as Domina in the ring no matter how many plebs you released to come help you at the end. I'm sure there are ways to do it but it dampens the replay value as everything sort of funnels the same way every time. This game could be legendary with some rethinking! \n\u2022 The second biggest con is, while the player input idea is neat and welcome, combat could be way more robust. First, you have to relearn moves every game so you can't do the good stuff until you have like 3 matches left anyway.  Second it feels too much like your input doesn't matter if the ai decides it should be winning even if you're really good. Which I am.  Because GUNDERKILL. Please develop the combat into awesomesauce because this too could be oh-so-good.\n\u2022 The third con for me is that I freed so many people that in the end the giant chorus of THANK YOU audio and absolute tsunami of sword fodder pretty much locked up my (powerful) computer and when it finally unstuttered after 5 entire minutes Domina was still dead.\n\u2022 Needs keyboard shortcuts to access the trainer and other commonly accessed areas of the game or you're mousing all over the place.\n\u2022 Needs buttons for \"reward all gladiators\" and trying to manage gear on a constant influx of glads is kind of a nightmare.\n\u2022 Would be cool if the Magestrate, Imperator, and Domina had some animations going to add to their personalities.  Drinking, lounging, whoring, yelling, writing, walking over to their sponsered gald and patting them on the head like \"good dog.\"  Stuff like that. Employees too because they are close to fixed images right now.\n\n\nAnyway, this game is just fun. It could be the absolute best with some changes.  Either way definately worth the price as it stands!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33441291", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499722504, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1499718133, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073171614", "playtime_forever": 1264, "last_played": 1530389887, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "One of the best management/RPG games I have ever played.

Really unique style of gameplay, blending resource management into a simple but effective combat simulator. The soundtrack is also incredible, and I've had the album on loop since I purchased the game.\n\nQuick game summary:\nYou play as a Roman aristocratic woman managing a gladiator school. Each game has a limited time system where you work and train up to the Roman championships, but all the while you have to fight in matches held by your patrons (a Roman legate and a magistrate). These can either help you by boosting your gladiator's stats if you're successful, end up killing them if you don't match-make against your opponents perfectly, or decrease your popularity if you don't send a gladiator to them, making the legate or magistrate less willing to help you out on your quest for glory. There are a ton of other elements (and I mean a //ton//) but that's the basic skeleton of the game.\n\nPersonal thoughts (13 hours in):\nIt's just the right blend of difficulty where I find myself swearing at the screen when I lose a gladiator I've had for a good portion of my game time, but punching the air even at the smallest of successes. Gladiators can either by controlled by the player or AI during matches, which adds a whole different element. You can choose to waste precious time training up AI stats, or try and take control yourself during matches.\n\nI also appreciate that the game doesn't babysit you or hold your hand. I actually thought that the tutorial was just part of the game and that it was glitching to cancel the \"real tutorial\" every time I selected the \"Start game with tutorial\" option. This made me feel a little lost for my first few games, but I appreciate now it's part of the style of the game and the atmosphere of the world. Nobody's going to help you out in ancient Rome, it's every man and woman for themselves. It's also very intuitive so I had no real problems getting stuck right in.\n\nAs a side note, I study Classics at university, by chance currently focusing on the late Republic/early imperial period. While the game doesn't appear to fall into any specific time period (there are some anachronistic references to Pompey, assumedly Pompeius Magnus, while it's clearly in Imperial Rome), it's such a no-holds-barred, funny, unique representation of gladiator and aristocratic Roman culture I don't mind the innaccuracies or find them distracting at all. As I said above, the brutality of the gameplay and the savage dialogue and choices you can make as a Roman woman outdoing her male peers perfectly reflects hundreds of years of Roman thought. The music is also a wonderful homage to the range of music the empire would have encompassed over their miles of provinces, and catchy as hell. Love everything about the atmosphere of the game.\n\ntl;dr: If you like micromanagement but want it upped x1000 with a really nice but (mostly) optional combat system and an absolutely immense soundtrack, buy this game.

In the ludus, you equip your gladiators, arrange their training, research, build things, manage resources and so on - in the above comparison, that'd be the Geoscape. Then, in the fights, you desparately hope that it was all enough as your guy squares off against today's no doubt fearsome opponent. Fights are short, brutal, and incredibly cathartic. You'll usually find yourself getting attached to a few of your gladiators (another XCOM similarity), for their value as a fighter if nothing else, making it all the more heartbreaking when they inevitably die, escape, or simply get released (if you're kind enough...). \n\nWhich brings me onto the major issue with this game: it has a serious balancing problem. Again going back to XCOM for a moment, if you lose your top squad in that (and weren't smart enough to have a contingency), it's almost always an option to scrape together what's left and try to build up from the ruins. Even if you can't, it's the seed for a dramatic story of your eventual gruelling defeat that plays out fantastically. In this, you lose even a single one of your well-trained gladiators, and you may as well quit and restart right there. There are no tactical decisions that can overcome the experience gap, neither are there any ways you can try and get them up to the level you need in time. You will never recover, and it doesn't even make for a particularly fun losing scenario either. So it certainly needs something extra there, such as maybe the option to enter some lower-risk fights or something. \n\nHowever, despite that one massive gripe, I still very much recommend this game. Even more so for its greatest feature: \n\nThe god-damn soundtrack. \n\nBrutal, dirty beats that are synced to the gameplay, with every single track perfectly evoking the brutality of the arena with trouser-tightening effectiveness.

I found the combat to be a little more shallow than I'd like - IMO the only strong tactic was having a shield and hiding behind it. Larger gladiator matches are pointless - everybody just blobs up and kills each other, which means you lose a lot of gladiators quickly (don't bring in your best gladiators to this type of matchup).\n\nSpeaking of best gladiators, it is super easy to have a single gladiator become nigh invincible. In every game I've played I've ended up with at least one super-gladiator that I could easily defeat a half dozen gladiators with, every time.\n\nWow, there was a lot of negative in the above paragraphs! Despite that, the management itself, while a bit shallow, is interesting.

I cant begin to tell you how this game managed to surpass every expectation i had for it and then some. When i had gladiators in the ring that i couldnt control (you can choose to control a gladiator later on.) i was on the edge of my seat, and since i was watching with a friend of mine I was actually cheering when my gladiators would succeed in the arena. This game is just so cool and i dont really know how to go about explaining it. To cut to the chase though you are Domina, the Lanista of the ludus left to you by your father. You can buy slaves who need to be trained to become good fighters, or buy for a much higher price a warrior that has already been in the ring. You have to manage your resources, like food, water, wine, and gold to make sure that you can keep the local politicians and your own gladiators happy. Your gladiators will go up against random challenges and you may or may not choose to control them. Regardless, the AI does a competent job of playing for you if you prefer to play that way, which is still very entertaining. I played on a slightly higher difficulty the first time around and man that was a challenge. I think the stock difficulty is a little bit too low, and i did find the game to run a painfully short. However there is an infinite-time mode. I recommend cranking the difficulty juuuuust up to \"normal\" for optimal fun/difficulty ratio. The stats on gladiators take a little while to figure out but after you have it, it's not hard to navigate. All in all it ia an excellent game and i am very glad it was gifted to me. It really is a decent representation of ludus management i imagine, with you having to navigate local politics as well as survive in the ring. This game is so amazing and unique and it does what it sets out to do unbelievalbly well, and that is be a fun and engaging ultra-violent pixel art Lanista experience.

I always thought a gladiatorial ludus similation/management game would be a great idea, but there didn't seem to be anything like that. Until Domina. Domina allows you to talk control of a Roman ludus as the lanista and domina. You will spend your precious time training and fighting gladiators, expanding your ludus, and engaging in political maneuvering to gain favor. There is a story to the game, but its very limited and not really the focus of the game.\nThe visuals and sounds of the game seem to be heavily influenced by the TV series Spartacus: Blood and Sand, which is fantastic. Lots of metal, lots of vulgarity, and a distinct graphic novel style; although with this game there is obviously a retro graphics twist, and of course an incredible amount of blood and gore.\nThough Domina is mainly supposed to be played as a simulation game, where you watch your gladiators fight after training them; you can choose to directly control one of your gladiators in a fight. This is an addition that I'm sure is welcome to a lot of players, personally I prefer to let the AI take control, but the option is there.\nMy only real complaint with the game is the way the campaign works. Most games like this would be endless, or at least very long, but Domina's campaign lasts only a couple of hours and it doesn't allow you to continue after it ends. There is an \"endless mode\" but it lacks the tournaments from the campaign that would serve as the end-game challenge and the mode is a lot less enjoyable as a result. This unfortunately hurts the game's replayability and longevity. Being able to take the game at your own pace would be nice. Simulation and management games usually have a relaxed pace but don't expect that here. You have limited time and you must use it wisely. Other than that issue though, Domina is superb, and its a steal for the price it is.\n\n8/10\n\nSuperb gladiatorial simulator, but lacks longevity.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33298656", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499310150, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1499306773, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052592078", "playtime_forever": 1099, "last_played": 1499385021, "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I've played this game for hours on end and will continue to play it because I enjoyed it very much.\n\nIt is a micromanaging gladiator game where you can choose to control a gladiator per battle or let AI control all your units.\n\nThere are helpers you can hire that have their bonuses (Blacksmith can quicky repair gear, freely upgarde a random piece of gear, and reduce cost when you want to purchase upgrades, Architect can build things that make training way more efficient and other facilities to improve quality of life for your gladiators, etc) and should definitely be looked into.\n\nGladiators have stats, upgradable skills from the trainer, and gear including Jupiter cards (special buffs). \nI've had naked gladitors find a weapon and kill an overgeared opponent before.

Day before the final battle a snake bit and killed my strongest gladiator of the other 14 cannon fodder. Another time a lion decided to eat my gladiator in RNG event lol. Yet another time my gladiator stabbed me, killed another gladiator and ran off with his female slave lover.\n2) There is an ability called CRITICAL STRIKE, that opponents may also have.

Gameplay consists of slave management in ludus (palace) and fighting in the arena.\n\n\nPLOT AND SETTING:\nPlot is random events via text prompts, the laziest method imaginable - although it is slightly forgivable considering the game's budget and size. Choosing to tame a lion during the same event in two different playtroughs can have different results, for no apparent reason other than RNGesus - again, boring and lazy design.\nThese faults, however, affect the gameplay more than the setting. The game's humour and plot elements are quite good overall. The setting feels autenthic, very Ancient Rome-ish.\n(15/20)\n\n\nGRAPHICS AND USER INTERFACE (UI):\nPixel art was never good looking, no matter what nostalgia goggles or modern indie game designers may tell you. The artstyle is consistent, but everything looks kind of the same from visual perspective: This is somewhat remedied by keeping the screen clean during training sessions, where every character is in their own specific area - and makes seeing anything in big fights impossible. Group fights are supposed to be chaotic, so I guess I can't complain.\nUI does its job in almost all cases, but fails in my opinion during the pre-fight menu: It is slightly cluttered, and sometimes annoying to look at.\n(14/20)\n\n\nGAMEPLAY AND CONTROLS:\nControls are intuative and fit the gameplay well. The gameplay itself... gets boring very fast. There is some variety in the fights, but you have to specificly gimp your game session if you want that variety (like lions) - otherwise its mostly the same old 1 dude versus 1 dude.\nThe game is challenging, but the constant randomness can be very irritating: It turns much of the game into a dice toss. Mainly, your far superior fighter can easily lose to enemy due to any reason at all, but most notably beause:\n1) Idiotic AI throwing a certain win, even when the AI value within the game is maxed.\n2) Enemy randomly having a Cursed Weapon buff, which you don't notice due to the UI. (Cursed Weapon is/was OP)\n\nThe game's difficulty curve is odd and inconvenient, and with the help of randomness it ruined much of the experience for me: Usually games are easy at the start, to get you going, and then ramp up the difficulty. DOMINA is difficult and frustrating at the start, then incredibly easy and boring at the midgame and end - making most of the game meaningless chore. Choosing a higher difficulty can help a little, but in my opinion the game is simply designed wrong in this aspect.\nI find it hard to decide whether to praise the game for not holding the player's hand, or chastice it for being a coin toss.\n(20/40)\n\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC:\nVoice acting and sound effects are tolerable. Music is surprisingly good, and sets the mood right.\n(17/20)\n\n\nOTHER FEATURES, BUGS AND GLITCHES\nGame has no multiplayer, but there seemed to be some options for Twitch: Streamers are propably thankful of that, but these options do not add any value for anybody else.\nGame seemed to work fine during the total 14 hours of play, and I did not encounter a single crash or game-breaking glitch. Option menu seemed very competent.\n\n\nSCORE:\nFor an overall score, I would rate the game as 66 / 100.\nWhat people value in a game are subjective and relative, but this game did not impress me.\n\nDespite the low score (I rate games much harsher than most others) its not an awful game, just a good idea with flawed execution. If you know what you're getting into, the game can be fun - but is ultimately so inconsistent as an experience, that I cannot recommend it for all audiencies with good conscience. It is tolerable as a short experience (5-6 hours), and worth the try if priced accordingly.\n\n-------------------------------\nNot Recommended\nPrice for a relatively good purchase:       7.50$  (and below)\n-------------------------------", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "33290498", "weighted_vote_score": "0.50134044885635376", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499287905, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1499287505, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047560688", "playtime_forever": 215, "last_played": 1499267795, "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "UFC's got nothin' on half-naked men being mauled to death by starved lions.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33290314", "weighted_vote_score": "0.489559173583984375", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1499287505, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"timestamp_created": 1499281386, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191240706", "playtime_forever": 1007, "last_played": 1528539675, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "It's annoying that my best fighter died by accidence.

But then final fight came, my champoin was slaughtered and i lost, which was a bit weird, but not unpredictable. But not that I wanted to replay game and do better.\n \nEvery other ways I tried... You have only so much money, so you can buy decent gear for 2-3 guys at best, learning is too slow and after, like, 10 minutes you are put against guy with almost high-end gear. So you have to put one of your 3 champions. And fights are fully randomised, so you cannot send your rookies against some other rookies, no, you fight someone who you are presented and they become rather powerful instantly. And you are given endless stream of rookies (like, 3-4 for every fight), and they are not just useless, they are annoying and useless since making such rookie decent fighter costs fortune in gold.\n\nAnd yes, game is utterly imbalanced. Guys with sword+shield are OP. I never colud hit opponent with spear guy (my AI opponent to could hit me and spear vs. spear usually ended in timeout and technical victory).

While each individual playthrough (assuming you reach the end) will not take very long(1-2 hours), the game has two possible endings which I will not spoil. The biggest fun in this game is to challenge yourself to win the game with different strategies and at higher difficulties. One gladiator to rule them all? A legion of trained supersoldiers? Do you want to buy pre-trained slaves? Do you want to train them from level 1 yourself? What class of gladiators do you want to use?\n\nThe game is not as deep as it (successfully) pretends to be, it's actually a pretty simple game, but it's a game with few well designed mechanics instead of many poorly designed ones and that is ok in my book as it makes an all around solid gameplay experience. Maybe next time I'll try to win with a guy wearing nothing but his underwear :D or a lion! (wonder if it's possible to win with these...)\n\nThis game is essentially all about gameplay and none about story and as such it has awesome gameplay, you can choose to control your gladiators or you can let them be AI controlled (I always did AI controlled though, it was more fun to watch the carnage than to participate imo) it's maybe a bit short but it's one of those games that's all about replay value, and does so successfully. I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would, and I definitely recommend it.\n\nMy only two complaints about it would be that even at it's hardest difficulty the game is pretty easy (what gets hard is only the beginning of the game, not the late game, or that's how I experienced it anyways) and that when you get slaves as a reward for winning matches, even if you sometimes get them fully equipped they are always level 1 untrained cannonfodder pieces of trash. (Normally there's nothing to do with them except sell them or free them, because you can't actually train them to become useful in combat since as the game progresses all your opponents get significantly stronger, a slave training every second of the game from the start to the end will be very weak compared to a slave that has won 4 or 5 battles, winning a battle boosts stats significantly more than actual training does, even if you have all the upgrades that make training faster active.

The UI is very clunky (clicking gladiators in the ludus is really hard and you often end up dragging on accident), and a lot of data is not sorted very well; stats are also rather obscure and their interaction is not very well explained, which makes balancing what you want more of a guessing game; comparing gladiators before a match is a massive pain as well, it's very hard to make out how strong an opponent is from the jumble of numbers. The combat itself is also very quick and often just a flurry, so it's very hard to learn from and make strategic decisions on what you did wrong and what you should improve, there is very little feedback.\n\nThere are also practically no safety nets; on multiple occasions I simply ran out of money and everyone starved to death, because there is no way to make money unless you already have money, and even then it's a gamble. Having to restart a whole game because of one mistake is not fun, so some kind of fallback mechanic would be very needed.\n\nThere is also a major flaw in the tutorial where the Jupiter Blessing boosts you can give your gladiators is locked until you defeat a boss, which takes a while to get to; but of course all your enemies have them, which makes the game even more difficult.\n\nI also don't really see why the 'training' part, which is the majority of the game, had to be real time; it just makes what would be management into a rush, and there seem to be really no point to it; you're going to automate training anyway, so it's not like the pseudo-clicker mechanic they kinda had in there has much purpose. I feel this part would have worked much better if it was simply turn-based. And yes, you can pause, but the game was clearly not designed for it.\n\nI don't know how fun the combat is when you actually mind-control a character, I never tried that out; I was looking for more of the management aspect, but unfortunately the game is just frustrating, and later a bit boring and one-note in that aspect.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "33216418", "weighted_vote_score": "0.501615941524505615", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499147072, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1499143296, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061494453", "playtime_forever": 841, "last_played": 1503812603, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Early game is pretty enjoyable, but the late game is pretty boring once you get to the point of 1-hitting literally everyone.

To be more exact he got eaten by a lion. I thought oh well, at least i have another gladiator, his name was Maximus, he entered the arena with flamming fists of fury. There was no hope, poor maximus' first fight was going disgracefuly, but there was an omen from the god-, the crowd, they had thrown Maximus a sword. Little did i know that Maximus was trained in the art of the sword and fiercly took his opponents arm off, we had one the battle. Later that night, Maximus commited suicide, absolutely no clue why but he did nevertheless. With the remaining funds i found a man named Fabius, he was your average 160 Kg man. Fresh of the slave market Fabius was a machine, i threw him a trident and a net and he was killer. Me and Fabius made lots of money together, until he also tried killing himself, however luckily for our Ludus he didn't quite kill himself. The day later was the grand championship, Fabius still letting blood went into the arena, rather than getting gutterstomped he was doing the gutterstomping.  He picked up his holy trident of posideon and smashed it right into the head of the opposing team, killing all of them. Fabius was my brain child, we had trained him so well, we were now extremely rich, we had even built a wine cellar! The next day i had received word that Fabius' slave wife had fallen pregnant and i decided to give her freedom. With my new found riches i hired 2 other extremely well trained gladiators, pormithius and toiletus. No one could beat us, my Ludus had become a stronghold of rome a symbol of hope. That very night, fabius scaled the walls of the Ludus and fled, never to be seen again. Never fear, i still had two trained fighters. The next day my gladiators had found a lion and i had asked them to tame it, sadly Toiletus was killed doing so. Our proud Ludus had become a one man army. \n\nR.I.P Pormithius who had jumped the compound and left forever never heard of again.\n\nWould i recommend this game?

This Indie is just one of the most beautiful indie i ever seen. In this game u can find a lot of things to do, with great variety, u can fight, you can manage your ludus and your gladiators, you have to do some different choise that are really important in the story. Now we have a \"story mod\" and an endless mod too, and that's a nice idea to spend time in a nice way, speccialy if u are a casual gamer. \nMUST READ THIS:\nDon't read comments which says that there is no possibility to save, NOW THEY ADDED SAVES AND THEY WORK FINE.\nThe requirements are not that, i mean i have a shitty computer payed 399 euros and i can run this game at 60 fps at maximum graphic. \nSo, if u want to buy this kind of game, U MUST BUY THIS! :D\nITA: Questo gioco \u00e8 fantastico, l'idea di gioco che ne \u00e8 alla base \u00e8 semplice ma geniale!

Questo indie \u00e8 uno dei pi\u00f9 belli che abbia  mai visto. In questo gioco puoi fare un sacco di cose, tutte cose molto varie, puoi lottare nelle arene, puoi gestire la tua ludus e i tuoi gladiatori e sono addirittura aggiunte delle scelte che devi fare, e compromettono almeno in parte l'avanzamento agiato nella storia. Ora esiste una modalit\u00e0 \"storia\" e una modalit\u00e0 infinita, che i permette di vedere i tuoi gladiatori diventare i pi\u00f9 forti e potenti su tutti. Questo gioco \u00e8 adatto sia a spendere un po' di tempo quando non si sa cosa fare, sia a \"nerdarci\" sopra per ore, come ho fatto io nelle ultime 2/3 ore. \nLEGGETE:\nI commenti che sono ancora presenti e dicono che non esistono i salvataggi non sono veri, QUESTO PROBLEMA E' STATO RISOLTO E ORA CI SONO I SALVATAGGI PER TUTTE LE MODALITA' E FUNZIONANO ALLA GRANDE.\nPoi, i REQUISITI NON SONO COSI' ALTI, ovvero io ho comprato il gioco con un pc di bassa fascia pagato 399 euro e gira a 60 fps tutto al massimo.\nQuindi, per concludere, se stai cercando questa tipologia di gioco, per nerdarci, e passare tanto tempo, o anche solo per passare qualche decina di minuti, questo gioco fa' per te!

These are the guys who sell you slaves and... are pretty useless otherwise. A good or bad standing with them doesn't seem to influence much, if anything at all. \n\n- You have 365 days to level and equip your dudes before the last battle.\n\n\nSo, the whole point is to get some of your gladiators strong enough within a year to beat the final fight in the grand coliseum. There's a good and a bad ending, and getting the good one is not easy.\n\nManaging your money works quite well, you gotta use it wisely. The other three resources available--food, water and wine--are rather irrelevant. All you need to do is spend like 5 coins to buy a lot of water and food every now and then, so your gladiators and staff don't starve and lose morale. Wine is only good to bribe one of the 2 NPCs, although it doesn't seem to be worth it.\n\nThe problem with the game is the balance: winning your first few fights can sometimes be a total nightmare. On the other hand, once one of your gladiators has achieved 5 victories or so, he becomes more of a Terminator and just rapes anyone thrown in front of him after that.\n\nOne sufficiently leveled gladiator is enough to beat the entire game, alone. But, if you want the \"good ending,\" you'll need more than that--and leveling more than one guy can be tricky, for if you send one of them into the wrong fight he may not be coming back.\n\n\nDomina is not a very complex game, but it has some decent depth to it. It starts off from a great idea, and executes it quite well. Right now, at 3 bucks or so (I assume, for Americans and Europeans) I'd say it's a no-brainer.

Thank Jupiter's Cock they finally put in a save system. The endless mode is amazing though there needs to be increasing challenge because I felt over time it got a bit boring unless you threw your standings with the two nobels into the red, then they tended to throw very cool challenging battles at you. It'd be awesome if in endless mode on the second playthrough the game avoided 1 on 1 battles and made the battles more larger as the default because by the second playthrough you have so many resources and lots of gladiators plus a seamingly endless supply of good gladiators for sale as well.\n\nIt would also be good if there were more regional battles as these provide a lot of fun in endless mode and its a shame there's nothing like the very final battle in the standard mode in the endless mode where there's just heaps of gladiators. Similarly it'd be cool to have gladiators you've set free return in endless mode like they do in the standard.\n\nVery fun game though and it really scratches the itch I've wanted from a gladiator management RPG. This does that and its actually pretty fantastic. The artstyle is very good, the music is just amazing and I can't beleive 1 developer made both. The engine is probably the only thing bad I can say about the game as for some reason the game suffers slowdowns and interface issues such as misclicks and freezing during button presses.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with this game and I hope the developer considers making an expansion pack allowing us to tour the entirety of the empire call it Domina: Gladius. I'd love to see that.\n\nFantastic game, really goes to show what an indie developer can do when they actually listen to feedback because this game has massively improved over time from when I first saw it on Youtube.

Is it perfect? No. There are components that are frustrating. I love that it is a roman gladiator micro-management game, because that's basically what it is. You train troops, give them gear, keep them fed, and teach new tactics while bribing the legate and magistrate so you can get better matches and rewards. Ensure you don't blow through gold whilst training and reseaching. If you run out of food, water, gold, or wine, it doesn't favor you. You take a penalty in troop morale.\n\nI played with the fights being AI. I found that if my gladiators had +10 hp and at least +10 attack, I'd win with the tactics path I researched in. I saw that you can learn how to control them, but I didn't select the option.\n\n\nNow, the game isn't perfect. Here are some cons:\n\n- You win slaves in fights, but too many will kill morale, so I had to keep selling newly earned slaves to not take morale penalties. I'd rather just not get them as a reward than receive a penalty.\n\n- You train these gladiators and sometimes random events will happen that will cause you to lose them. If their morale is low enough, they'll run away. Sometimes they lose in a fight and are put to death. It's really fustrating to train them, and lose them.\n\n- Death after a fight is really frustrating to me because it is a button mashing event against a clock, to see if you can get the crowd to favor your gladiator enough to live. I was likely doing it wrong, but I found that mashing both the mouse and keyboard keys helped, but not a lot. Again, you train them and lose them. It seems to be the point of the game, but it feels punishing after a while. I'm also really bad at these kinds of game events (I always was)\n\n- More random events. So, the random events are okay, but not great. Most of the time they are between the legate and magistrate and if you choose one above the other, or neither, you lose favor for matches. So, you need to bribe them with wine, but because you haven't had a fight in 15 days, you're out of wine, and low on coin... Kinda see what I'm getting at?\n\nAlso, gladiator random events are like employees trying to call out of work for the day on a friday before a 3 day weekend: My wife is with child. I'm old. I don't have the love to fight anymore. Wouldn't you rather see me as a free citizen and know you're helping me? You don't really want me as a slave, do you?\n\nI let one go, because he was useless to me and my camp was full, so I was losing morale every few seconds from overcrowding. Releasing the gladiator got me a morale boost with my troops, but suddenly EVERYONE was asking to be released and freed. Every rejection depletes morale. Eventually, after 10+ release request prompts (that literally spammed me), I lost my best gladiator who ran away from low morale. Maybe if I killed a slave, the requests would stop, and I would only take a single morale hit.\n\nI'd still recommend this game. Just don't play it to win. This game isn't always forgiving with the randomness.

About 17 minutes in and it's clear I won't enjoy the game. Yet another steam game that is \"cheap for a reason\".

Here's why I don't like it and will refund:\n\n1) There is no tutorial visible to the player upon loading up. \n2) I thought you'd at least have time to \"manage\" in this game, but the days move on in real time really quickly like a RTS, never ending or giving time to pause and think.  Before you know it you're in battle without knowing what is going on, and with some slaves without any decent equipment. There is no clear explanation for the games features. \n3) In the campaign I sent in 3 gladiators against 1 and their champion used one swipe first hit to kill all 3 in one go.  Ridiculous.\n4) Even if you understood the functions it looks basic strategy.\n5) The style of the game looks more appealing in screen shots than actually in game. I don't like the undetailed art work.\n6) The battles are random and over in a flash.\n7) Seems to get boring VERY quickly, a common theme of quite a few reviews.\n\nOne good thing is the music score is good.  \n\nIf I give one nod to a good historical \"roman games\" PC game, I say this is definitely NOT Qvadriga (A VERY good game that is a good example of how a small developer can make a fun historical game).  This game misses on many points and needs much development to make it worth time to play it. I expected this to be the Gladiator version of Qvadriga but it falls wide of the mark. \n\nIt seems the Gladiator genre is STILL without a good quality game, despite many a developers attempts.\n\nThere might be a good game in here somewhere, as near 90% reviews are positive.

Until I ended up watching fights and having my seemingly superior gladiators get their asses kicked in fights that they should have been winning. Look, it's no problem if that happens, fine. The problem is that there's no feedback whatsoever as to why this occurs. The action happens so quickly that you're left scratching your head as to why what happened occurred.\n\nSo after bumbling through blindly for my first couple of games I decided to consult some guides to try and figure out what the hell was actually going on during the fights. Turns out... There really aren't any to be had. There are guides out there that will tell you what upgrades to purchase, who to employ, etc. But nothing about what stats guide gladiators and how they interact with other types during battles. So maybe nobody actually knows? Maybe the stats play out somehow, or different types of gladiators beat other types in a rock-paper-scissors style triangle, but if there was some kind of framework guiding such interactions then I was blind to it. It seemed like the two sets of AI simply ran at each other until one randomly died. I couldn't tell whether superior equipment was the cause, or a stat like aggression or evasion came out on top. I'm not asking for the game to hold my hand, I'm asking for the game to be a game and allow me to learn and improve by having its underlying systems be identifiable. They are not, and as a result, it just feels cheap and left up to chance no matter what you do in your gladiator school, even on the easiest difficulty setting.\n\nI ended up following a guide which said to increase your gladiators' AI all the way via meditation and hire key employees and take key skills, so I did that, yet the same thing kept happening. In some fights my gladiators would absolutely paste the competition, in others they'd just be completely ineffective and die. I had one specific instance where one of my gladiators was absolutely crushing the competition, taking minimal damage and 3-shotting enemy gladiators. Then, abruptly, against an enemy gladiator with seemingly inferior statistics, he got absolutely starched and killed.

Everything else being a counter-intuitive, arbitrarily unforgiving slog.\n\nWhile the game presents a huge variety of training regimes, assistant upgrades, equipment and so on, there are primarily just two viable paths of getting anywhere. One is to send 1-2 warriors into every possible fight until they become superheroes capable of decapitating 15 people in a single strike, or you can spread out the experience to a larger number (say, 4-5) gladiators, and then make sure to sacrifice several slaves to unwinnable matches so you can keep a good number of \"lost\" battles in your stats.\n\nThe reason for this is that the relative difficulty of each fight (be it in the local marketplace, at the sponsorship of the local leaders or even in the coliseum at Rome) is mostly determined by how many combats you've won overall.\n\nSo, if you have one champion who is capable of taking on Rome's best and bravest, your fresh slaves will be unable to compete anywhere as their opponents will be scaled towards providing a challenge to your single best warrior... After a while spent in a campaign, you no longer have any low-tier fights to train people with.\n\n\nThat's probably the worst offender, and the one that's bothered me the most (aside from when the game gives you a match against 28 enemy gladiators, causing so much sound lag that the game shudders to a halt while trying to process everything). \n\nAlso included are: \n*Vast quantities of fresh, useless slaves heaped into your training field that need to have personal, individual management (you cannot set standard training regimens for new warriors, and they won't automatically stop training a particular skill when they reach the cap, requiring you to manually check through everyone to make sure they're not just standing around being completely useless).\n\n*A combat system that requires an upgrade to allow you to manually control a gladiator in a fight, and that requires skill training for the AI to fight by itself. Also featuring \"hit thing until it dies before you do\" levels of system complexity, which eventually gives way to a surprise cameo from the Dark Souls PvP scene, wherein everyone is rolling everywhere until someone pulls off a swing that defies all laws of physics and hitboxes in order to instantly obliterate anyone unfortunate enough to be in its general vicinity.\n\n*A direct-upgrade path of equipment upgrades, wherein some upgrades are actually worse in all ways to the required step before it. And yes, in order to equip a soldier with one gladius, you first need to buy him a dagger, then a wooden gladius, then finally the metal gladius. Again, no way to define a preset loadout for new warriors, so you need to inspect each one individually and mash the right mouse button for each weapon, pauldron, greave, torso and skirt you want to equip on your little dress-up dolly.\n\n*The cringiest, try-hardiest ambient swearing/insults I've heard in a very long time. Thankfully this can be turned off, as there are only so many times you can hear the painfully drawn out slurs before you begin to feel bad for everyone involved in the voice recordings for this game, especially since some pre-match insults are so long-winded that they take longer to finish than the actual combat.\n\n\nSo, in summary, this is a gladiatorial combat management sim with bad gladiators, bad combat, bad management, and also bad sim.\n\nIt's not, however, a *bad* game... Just a deeply disappointing one that doesn't live up to its potential.", "comment_count": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "33055105", "weighted_vote_score": "0.686969995498657227", "votes_up": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498855496, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498852925, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119999505", "playtime_forever": 634, "last_played": 1529783958, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Mark a Review as Helpful ... or not\nDid a Steam community review help you make a decision about a game?

I'll explain...\n\nThe good:\n\n- The general aesthetic of this game is great. You're presented with an absurdly brutal roman gladiator world, full of pixelated gore and chanting crowds. The animations, writing, audio and overall presentation are spot on. The over-the-top violence is genuinely charming, if such a thing can be. Each fight left me grinning.\n\n-  The mix of management and combat is engaging. You fill your ludus (gladiator school) with slaves won from fights or bought on the market, you chose to raise them as one of three classes, give them training schedules and buy them gear to prepare them for the carnage. You can also hire various trainers and support staff to either improve you school or give buffs and blessings to you gladiators. Once they're ready, you send them into the ring. There's regular scheduled fights, exhibition/pit fights you propose yourself, or later in the game when you've built up your school, you can take on boss fights. You can choose to manually control one figher, or watch the AI carry out the blood letting.  There's 1v1 fights and group fights of varying degrees of fairness, sometimes with lions and other obstacles. It's so satifsying when a gladiator you've trained up from a puny slave to a savage god of violence takes on three opponents at once, splattering them into little giblets of pixelated red mess.\n\n- The pacing feels right. In the normal story mode you have one year to build up your school and prepare for the final grand tournament, which has an unexpected twist that I won't spoil. You feel under pressure to prepare, but not rushed. You have time experience ups and downs during the course of a game and drama builds.\n\n- I've run the game on an ancient laptop potato and it's fine. It's also graced by a lack of bugs, which is refreshing.\n\nThe not good:\n\n- The balance is way, waaaay off, which is such a shame because it spoils what should be a really good game. The AI opponents scale with the number of fights you win and the strength of your best gladiator. As a result, you're forced to use your best fighter (invariably one of your starting three) in every fight or you get utterly creamed. You end up with one god-tier war deamon that can one-shot whole groups of opponents, but there's not point in filling out your school and training any other gladiators, because they are never able to catch up with the AI, no matter how you train and gear them.\n\n- The game is not hard or easy, because there's really only one strategy that's viable. If you follow it to the letter, you definately win and it's easy. If you deviate from the stategy you definately lose and it's impossible. That's not fun. On the surface you seem to be presented with a lot of choices and strategic detail (selecting slaves, gear, training, skill trees etc.), but because of the poor balance you don't get to play with them. There's only one path to victory. In a game like this, I want to do different things on each run, explore possibilities, and earnin the satisfaction of learning new ways to win. But that's not possible, so I'm not inclined to play again.\n\nPlease dev(s?), sort out the balance problem, and I'll update the review accordingly.

This can be earned in regular scheduled fights organized by the Magistrate or the Legato (keep them in your good graces) or by pit fights in the local market that are always a risk. You can also control one gladiator in the fights yourself, but I believe most will want the AI to take over since those fights are quick and brutal.\n\nAs your main gladiators get stronger, experienced and better equipped you can start fighting in regional championships to eventually get to the final in Rome. When they start getting powerful you'll also get cocky and start shouting \"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?\" each time one of your champions wipes the floor with the opposition in less than three seconds.\n\nExpect to get hammered throughout and lose some good men in the process, but there are always more slaves and gladiators for purchase in the empire. You can always send cheap slaves to the slaughter when you know you'll be outmatched, it's as easy as sending Christians to the lions (there are lions).\n\nThe developers are still updating the game and we can expect more features in the future. An endless mode has recently been added.\n\nThose who are about to die salute you.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "33017772", "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498785719, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498785663, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960793685", "playtime_forever": 682, "last_played": 1498786640, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I've been told that this game was made by one man, that includes all the artwork, music and everything. If so, it's a fine achievement.\n\nDomina is an amazingly fun game for the price. The \"Story mode\" has you as a Domina, running a Ludus of Gladiators. It operates like a simulator game. You train gladiators, hone their abilities, and buy their gear, and then see them fight in the arena. You have the ability to control them, eventually, but I found it more fun to just let them go at it. The game really reminded me of the STARZ TV show Spartacus, including all of the Roman intrigue. The action in the game is fast and furious and bloody, and I found myself cheering at my gladiators when they were victorious.\n\nMy one \"complaint,\" if there is any, is that there should be an upper-cap on how strong gladiators can get. Especially in the Endless Mode, gladiators basically can death-ball after not too long. I am currently on my third year, and I have a gladiator with over 1500hp (they usually have between 100-200). His gladatorial bouts last less than a second, as he simply sprints up and beheads anyone in his path. I've even put him up against 15, all by himself, and he emerged without a single lost hit point. As hilarious as this is, it kind of takes away from the fun eventually, as there's no real challenge anymore.\n\nOtherwise, great game. Totally worth the price.

(There are 4)\n  - Train and equip them with armor and weapons. (Individual gladiator stat managment)\n  - Add ability cards for bonuses such as \"Gladiator loses 1/2 HP but gets 500% more damage. (up to 4 cards per gladiator)\n  - Pit them against other gladiators in 1 vs 1, multi vs multi, 1 vs multi and other various modes. (modes are randomly selected)\n  - Participate in battles within the Championship, underground fights, standard event battles or by setting up fights with other NPC's gladiators/slaves.\n\nNOTE: This game has the unique ability to change how the game is played.  You can beat it by letting the AI control the combat or if you unlock the skill for mind control you can then play in the arena yourself with a selected gladiator.  Having this option allows players to decide how they want to play (ie: I didn't control any of my gladiators when I beat the game for the first time and was fully satisfied with the outcome and experience getting there; however it did require close attention to my gladiators core stats when I acquired them such as if they tend to turtle or are much more aggressive.)  This leads to very interesting matches that require you to consider the \"what if X happens\" of the AI but is not unfair.\n\n1.) Graphics/Fidelity (4/5)\n - Looks great but can be difficult to distinguish between gladiators.  Plenty of execution animations with limbs and heads flying off.  I personally love this art style as it gets the detail across enough to cut all the fat out.  Frame rates can drop significantly if your training grounds are full (developer is currently working this one out.)  I have primarily seen these types of issues in the Endless mode but this is to be expected since this mode is experimental for the moment.  This is not a game with high fidelity, no pixel art game will be for obvious reasons.\n\n2.) Interface (4/5)\n - Easy to learn, fairly clean and to the point. Intuitive to the point where you won't be asking what everything is as the roll over text can/will assist.  Unfortunately, there is an issue with the armor section when equipping your gladiators and will sometimes lead to clicking the wrong section.  This could easily be fixed by aligning the gear boxes into rows and columns but it's a minor annoyance.  Another minor annoyance/preference is how the gladiators are ordered; I would have preferred the ordering to follow standards such as a book (top to bottom, left to right in rows) but instead they seem to be arranged by... level?)\n\n3.) Sound/Music (3/5)\n  - I find the sound effects to be spot on, music was average and fit the minimalist style of pixel art games.\n\n4.) Gameplay (4/5)\n  - The gameplay is great when I compare it to something like a Plague Inc. and gets better when you introduce the ability to take over in the action but... the combat on the keyboard wasn't intuitive and required me to go into the options to find out what the key binds were (pretty typical these days with indie developers but at least they were there.)  \n  - Doesn't appear to have controller support which would have made the title much more accessible and easier/quicker to pick up and play.\n  - Combat can feel like you're floating around or sliding on ice at times but this only happens a little and based on the rest of the game mechanics, it was intended and works well.\n  - Gladiator stats and gear are great RPG additions and add depth towards the end game content.\n  - Stat balancing is good enough as it's a single player game.\n  - Ability cards are also a good addition.  This was nicely balanced as even the NPCs can use them however I do wish the core combat skills were not locked until mid-game due to upgrade times.\n  - All animations are appropriate and feel like they belong.\n  - Classes are fairly balanced, polearms appear to have a very distinct advantage and should have been revisited since only 1 class can use polearms and nets.  There are 2 items in the progression tree pertaining to this class in order to be capable of defending against this class when no other class has these types of barriers.  Perhaps this was intended though.\n  - The other game mechanics fit right in and are a healthy addition as they can add flavor to the mix of the playthrough due to random generation of certain assets (ie: ability cards, slaves, gladiators, matches, etc.)\n\n5.) Overall (4/5)\n  - It was a great game that has a level of immersion that I seldom see in games.  From building your gladiators up, losing your most beloved one to a mistake you made previously to the combat, this is a fairly well balanced game with great potential for crazy situations to play out.  I loved the art direction, the sounds were fitting and more importantly memorable, the gameplay was challenging and gave me options on how I preferred to beat it (Micromanagement or general... I chose general at first.)\n\n6.) Buy at full price or on sale?  I would purchase at either (I paid full) as most games are not as well done as this one, considering all that is going on and how much control you have over your resources makes for various play styles.  Compared to most indie titles, this one is on par with games like Axiom Verge or Stardew Vally regarding its team size and production quality and the developer appears to still be refining it after release which is appreciated and shows that they care about the title itself.\n\n\"Meats was not the best gladiator.  After many losses which caused me to frantically click to save his worthless life, he finally caught a break and received an ability card that would help him with his weapon training.  Soon Meats would go on to almost single handedly bring down the colosseum championship but he impregnated one of my slaves and I accidently sentenced him to death.  I still received the good ending but it sure created a wrinkle in my operations for the next 100+ days...

I'm not gonna say \"oh if there was a neutral option I'd use it!\" because I wouldn't. Domina is a sort of Roman gladiator simulator thing where you're a ludus, think of it like a slavemaster, but instead of slaves, they're slaves with armour and swords I guess. Apparently the entire game was made by one guy, so that's cool? However; just because a few/single people/person worked on a game, doesn't exempt it from having criticism. That being said, pros, cons, blah blah blah. [b][i][u]TL;DR will be at the bottom.[/u][/i][/b]\n\n\n\nP\u0280\u1d0fs\n\n\u2022The soundtrack is lovely. Normally I don't  do the whole \"oh the sound design is absolutely wonderful!\" shtick, Hell I barely pay attention unless there's vocals half the time, but Domina's hard EDM-style soundtrack is catchy, very Hotline Miami-esque at times (not really but I mean comparisons apparently make you look cool so sure.) This also has a downside, but we'll get to that\n\n\u2022Watching your Gladiator (yes, singular. Again, we'll get to that.) train and equiping him with all this decked out armour and stuff is Hella satisfying. You can control them via a skill thing I guess but I never really bothered.\n\n\nC\u1d0f\u0274s\n\n\u2022Remember that cool kid soundtrack I mentioned? Why in the Hell is it in a damn Roman-era Gladiator game? I mean I guess it's 8-bit so it fits, but it isn't even some form of remix or something. This con isn't really that prevalent, good music is good music, but it kinda takes you out of the atmosphere (if you can say an iso-view arena fighter thing has atmosphere.)\n\n\u2022When you first get the game, early game is abysmal. The enemies you face and the loot you get from beating them is complete RNG, meaning you can just get an enemy Gladiator that's 1.5x your health and double your damage, and if you beat him, congratulations! You get 147 gold and like 2 Wine!\n\n\u2022Adding onto the previous point, once you know how the game works and all that, late game is a borefest. You just watch as your Gladiator two or three shots all opposition. Eventually you'll go face the behemoths or whatever, the first couple won't really be a challenge, and at times you can even recruit them if they don't die. This is apparently a pretty rare occurance, but I had two of them around by the time the pretty much hardest fight from it happened. I had my Gladiator that carried early-mid game and was still carrying late game, two behemoths, and an extra Gladiator when the hardest Championship game thing happened, both behemoths went in at half health. In the next five seconds, all of the opposition was dead and the only people that died was one of the behemoths and the extra Gladiator. What. A. Pushover. Multiple combatants aren't necessary at all. Only reason I even had the Behemoths was because you can't sell them. And the only reason I had the extra gladiator was because I was trying to get the \"Thraex Champion\" achievement, which I didn't even get after having three fully upgraded Thraexs. That's cool.\nI should mention, there's like 10 fights but you only unlock the 10th after beating the main game (I guess successfully?) When I refer to the \"hardest fight,\" I'm talking about the hardest of the original 9 fights.\n\nTHE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS GAMEPLAY-DRIVEN GAME WITH A MINISCULE STORY SPOILED DON'T HOVER OVER THE BIG BLACK BOX KTHX.\n[spoiler]\u2022The ending is flat out stupid. Apparently I had a rival (who I only heard of like twice, once right at the beginning then one of the random event things) and he convinced the old slave trader man and the edgy gladiator kingpen guy I was gonna kill them or something. So I was put on trial for like conspiracy or something and it was me who was now in the arena thing against a Helluva lotta gladiators about to kill me. Apparently, you can get past slaves to help you if you free them or something, but all I really did was free the ones I got that weren't already armoured and had classes that would only be sold for 2 gold so I didn't stand a chance. Also my frames absolutely died with an i5-6600k overclocked to 4.6 GHz and a 1060. I guess it was a lot of pixelated violence or something? Should my PC have dropped like 40 frames from that? I dunno. I'm not mad that the naked slave men didn't kill them, I'm mad that this scummy below-the-belt move just gets straight up pulled on you for no reason with next to no real warning.[/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\u1d1b\u029f;\u1d05\u0280\nDomina is an alrite game, I guess. A catchy but out of place soundtrack and a mildly fun early-mid game if you know what you're doing.

All in all, the game is very well-done, though slightly unrealistic after a certain point, especially on Endless, due to the fact that you can grind a single gladiator to infinite levels. \n\nThe concept is really interesting though.

Simple as that.\n\n[b]Worth The Price[/b]\nI would say that Domina, especially under the Summer Sale, is a game worth trying out. $4.99 is minimal for a game that you can spend at least thirty hours on grinding, to achieve achievements and other various things.

Although it mainly steers towards a pixel art/beat 'em up style game, it also accommodates other genres, such as RPG elements and game altering scenarios which can change the how a fight is setup, either stacking odds for or against the player. \n\nPROS:\n-Good combat system, with proper balancing\n-Amazing sound track\n-Beautiful 'Pixel Art' graphs\n-Good enemy scaling\n-Interesting battle environments\n-Easy to learn and enjoyable to play\n-Allows the player to fight by controlling their gladiator, or having an AI do it for them (Either way works, as the AI tends to be incredibly smart, while not having a clunky control system if the player decides to control their gladiator)\n-HUGE variety of weaponry, armour and enemies (As well as the statistics that each gladiator has)\n-Plenty of 'Random Event' scenarios, some of which can be game changing, while others are just for giggles\n-Doesn't baby the player, but also doesn't completely destroy them\n\nI don't realistically consider the following as negatives, but more as suggestions to improve the game:\n\n- Add an 'Auto Fight' feature, which allows the player to choose the gladiator they want to fight, whom will then complete the fight automatically (With or without showing the battle, either way is fine). This would be very useful, since everytime a gladiator becomes 'OP', they can win the fight with no trouble, especially when easy opponents are challenging. Although, it should be made that a warning/pop-up comes up when an opponent might be a fair or challenging match (Based on statistics of the gladiator compared to the player's), as this will allow the player to choose whether or not they should control the gladiator or not.\n\n- While it's not necessary, it would be nice to be able to cancel whatever the employee is doing (IE, Architect constructing a Wine Cellar), but with obvious repercussions. For instance, the player might cancel the Architect building something, but they don't get the resources back, while also wasting their own time. Even still, it could be made that the employee gets incredibly annoyed and leaves while also taking money as a \"Service Fee\".\n\n- The text that pops up to inform the player (IE, 'Deck Full') should move a bit more smoothly, as it tends to be off putting when compared to the game's astonishing graphics.\n\nI understand that this game is a beta, so I'm hoping in the future we get way more content, which I doubt won't be done. Nonetheless, the game is still packed to the brim with things to do, so I'm not really complaining right now.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game and plan to continue playing it.\n\nIS VERY GOOOOD", "comment_count": 1, "received_for_free": true, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32976484", "weighted_vote_score": "0.487084865570068359", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1511723707, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498717992, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031585429", "playtime_forever": 398, "last_played": 1526716027, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Fun little game.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32975992", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498717992, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498717122, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141203568", "playtime_forever": 650, "last_played": 1512457229, "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Just trust me, get this, get emotionally attached to your head gladiator, free him after 6 hours of gameplay. \n\nThe music is great, it's pretty simple to work, took me a while to figure out how to save my guys from dying.

Because of how simple everything is though, there wasn't much replayability for me.

I'm guessing you have to be a person who loves replaying games with different tactics to really understand this game because I can see some people have ten times more hours than me and seem to love it, but as someone with a short attention span I just couldn't get that into it.

Every element in this game revolves around violence and profanity, reflected in the arena. Though the graphics are pixelated watching your gladiators head get decapitated feels like it has a lot of impact. \n\nGameplay: In Domina you train warriors, hope they don't die, and then train them some more. During my playthrough it often felt like the gameplay was just a way to give the player a break from the violent arena battles. One thing you can do is change the name of your gladiators (they get mad if you do so, but if you give them enough wine they will be okay with it). I kind of like this feature since it allows the player to feel invested into their gladiator. There are other aspects in between the arena battles, with each having their good and bad points, but to save time I am just going to give three tips to make your playthrough a little bit smoother from the begining. Level up weapons as much as possible, wear as little armor as possible, and make sure to get gladiators with high agility. Overall I would rate the gameplay 7/10 (5/10 if you don't like watching battles)\n\nStory: You inherited some gladiators and have a year to prove your worth. Thats pretty much it. There is an ending as well, 3 to be precise. A good ending, a bad ending, and an inbetween ending. Overall I give the story a 6/10.\n\nMusic: Not much in between battles, but in the arena fights it does a great job setting the mood. Overall I give the music 7.5/10\n\nCharacters: The dialogue is very agressive, violent, and sexual, with a dash of humor. It does an alright job adding some humanity to the characters, but sometimes comes off a bit immature. Overall I would give the dialogue 6.5/10.\n\nThis game caters to a relatively specific audience. People who are fans of battle simulator games would most likely enjoy this game, as well as anyone with an interest in roman colloseums.

If you have ever played FTL you will most likely like this game. \n\nOn the gameplay side this game is FANTASTICLY good. It has in-depth research and you have to manage money, food, water, wine and your amount of gladiators. Do not rely too heavily on your best gladiator early game or you will get pwnd when he will eventually fall. Im not joking. Scripted events are fun but are very one sided outcomes. After doing one event all you have to do is choose the same one you did before if you got it right. Equipment is a vital section of the game as it can really determine life or death situations. (Fun Fact: a naked gladiator with no equipment can defeat a mid level character using a crowd's gift). \n\nThe story is a bit lightweight but the fun thing is that it does not matter much. Your fights and choices will be your story. Most of the time it is probably for the best. For example (referencing my own gameplay) having 1 man in maxed out gear go up against 5 people at once and kill them all 1 after the other in a cool series of takedowns with getting a scratch. This gladiator then went on to defeat all 12 regional champions.\n\nCombat is fun as HELL the amount of fun I've had seeing these pixel men beat the lights out of eachother is substantial. Mind Control being unlocked early in the tech tree is a good part on the developer. Researching far enough will allow your guys to throw swords, roll into people and hurt them as well as a lot of defense buffs. Lions being available for use is great but I wish that lions on the enemy team would appear a lot more. Class wise it is a bit shallow. 3 classes with set out playstyles: Want long reach? Retarius. Want lotsa damage? Murmillo. Tough tank? Thraex. Having more variety in the class system would raise this games standard to something magical.\n\nOverall this game is brilliantly bloody and fun. Maybe not suitable for 9 and older though.\nRating: 9.5/10\nBetter if: More classes", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32955571", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1498680283, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498678597, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101723830", "playtime_forever": 750, "last_played": 1515624432, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Awesome game, massively addictive.

Occasionally, you'll be prompted to make various political decisions.

Train your gladiators, and fight them for glory and profit. \n\n[b]The Reality:[/b]A feature-poor, visual-poor, control-poor, explination-poor, unintuitive mess. With a good soundtrack. \n\n[h1]Tutorial   (1/5)[/h1]\n---------------------\n\nThe \"tutorial\" fails to inform you of what is actually [b]important[/b] in this game. It introduces you to the doctori (a.k.a research tab), and the Magistrate and Legate (essentially factions with stores). That's about it. No mention that you need to train your gladiators, keep them healed, fed, and supplied with water, nor how to do these basic things! \n\nThe regional championships are mentioned in passing, but what is [b]not[/b] mention is that they are [b]mandatory[/b] for winning the game! You can go through the entire game and not once realize that without doing these missions you will fail. \n\n[h1]Gameplay / Control / UI  ( 1/5)[/h1]\n---------------------\n\nFirst of all, the biggest problem with the game is that it is in real-time. This is a strategy/management game where there is no ability to slow or stop time and do all the minor things that need to be done to win. You must curry diplomatic favor, buy slaves, buy supplies, train, research, equip slaves, set sliders, and choose fights all within each round of between 30 seconds to 1 minute between fights. What is worse, these mandatory fights have [b]no impact[/b] on winning the game! The fights that do determine game progress are chosen as an [b]option[/b]! What sense does that make? Horrible, horrible design choices. \n\nGameplay in the arena takes 2 forms. You can either let the AI fight, or manually control a gladiator after you research \"mind control\" with the doctori. The AI takes into acount the gladiator's Meditate ability to determine how well they fight. This ability is gained just like the others, set it in the training sliders. The problem is, to use the AI option means you must devote valuble training time to it, neglecting actual skills like Attack and Defense. \n\nObviously that means you will want to control your gladiators manually. The problem with this is 2-fold. 1) The actual fighting controls are terrible. 2) it is impossible to tell what is happening on-screen. The reason for being unable to tell is that the low-pixels graphics are well, low-pixel graphics. It's hard to tell what you or your opponent are doing if you are both 8x8 sprites. On top of that, the game moves at lightning speed. Once again, extremely amateurish design choices. \n\nThe UI is a joke. Nothing is labeld, necessary features like auto-train, and auto-aim are off by default, and no tool tips or manual. \n\n[h1]Sound 4/5[/h1]\n--------------\n\nIt's no suprise the soundtrack costs nearly as much as the game.  It's the only thing that feels \"professional\" about the game. That said, it is wildly inappropriate for this game. Techno/Dubstep does not belong in a gladiator game. \n\n[h1]Fun 0/5[/h1]\n--------------\n\nThis game is mostly about management. I love management games. This game makes management extremely un-fun. There is absoloutly [b]no reason[/b] this game couldn't have been turn-based. If I only have a finite amount of time to complete tasks before the next fight, then use a time resource, not a real-time clock that penalizes non-twitchy players. And definately not one that can be measured in seconds. Honestly, who makes a management game twitch-based? That's like making a sim-platformer, or a puzzle-sports game.  \n\n[h1]Final Verdict [/h1]\n---------------------------\n\nNot worth full price. Not worth half-price. Possibly worth getting at 80% or below just to try. I'm sorry, I know the game is made by just one guy, but that in no way excuses a $10 price tag for a game that doesn't deliver any fun and is riddled with amateur design choices.

TLDR; A cost effective gladiator management simulator with humor and twists far beyond what you would expect with even a price point of $10. \n\nEvery play through is slightly different, and the variety between single playthrough and endless brings even more possibilites, so long as you don't lose interest in the process. The game feels very... grindy to a certain extent, but not in a bad way necessarily. For example, every few days a fight will be requested from one of two NPCs (Legate and Magistrate), but in the mean time you are expected to train your combatants, equip them, research new skills, and provide their basic needs for survival. At times, you overspend on armor or weapons to find yourself strapped for food or water, which can lead to game over. You can ask either the Legate or the Magistrate to arrange an exhibition match, which is basically the same idea as the reoccuring matches except it can reaaaaally go bad depending on how much that NPC likes/dislikes you. Even if you lose and your champion dies, you earn just enough money to buy food and water to keep the game going, and eventually add more gladiators to your roster. \n\nFight scenarios vary between a standard 1v1 up to 6v6, include lions (chained or free roaming), and are very sproradic in nature. Your most seasoned warrior can be slain in an instant if you're not careful, and your underdog can rise above the rest if you take a chance. \n\nIn some instances, the hosts of the fight are throwing everything they have (1v6 for example) just to kill your strongest gladiator, but that just makes things more interesting when you win. It's also worth bringing up that all the gear used can absolutely break on you at the worst time, so invest in a faber (blacksmith) to repair your gear between fights. The crowd will toss in weapons and shields at times, so even then it's not the end of the world. In some cases, your warrior will surrender knowing he is beaten, and is given the chance of redemption based on how insanely quick you can click your LMB + RMB. \n\nAt any rate, it's worth mentioning that even such a small production is being supported and developed with the end user (you) in mind. Updates are provided regularly, patch notes; while shorthand, are provided at every opportunity, and compatability seems to be consistent across the board. I am very excited to think of the DLC/Expansions that will follow this base game. \n\nIf you've read this far, you're probably ready for some cons or what doesn't shine as bright with this diamond in the rough. Well, the main thing is progression. Once you beat the single playthrough, you're left wondering if you could have made a difference in the ending by being more compassionate to your gladiators by releasing them on time/before their requests, or if that has any bearing on the end result. Well, from what I could tell, it does not. \n\nThere are variations on the ending, but the idea is that you are a slave driver more or less and you inevitably reap what you sew. Aside from that, once you've got all the gear purchased for a gladiator, and have an upgraded medicus and faber, you have a tank who will heal and repair/upgrade quickly enough to consistently fight for you at every opportunity, thus becoming a herculean monster who can do nothing else but decimate his competition and humbly ask for your mercy before the championship fight (sorry buddy, you're sticking around for this one).\n\nAgain, even at the $10 mark,  this game shoots straight and provides a quality sim experience for those who love pixelated gore and experimenting with different playstyles. Every playthrough is unique. Even if you think you know the outcome of a fight based on stats, you'd be surprised how many times you're mistaken. I give this game in it's current state 9/10, and in my hopes eventually 10/10 once more content is pushed out.", "comment_count": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32841566", "weighted_vote_score": "0.490654200315475464", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498537806, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498536675, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980019537", "playtime_forever": 906, "last_played": 1501764283, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Rally your gang of misfit fighters and take on the role of Domina in this Ludas management simulator.

Both game modes (Story & Endless) are both identical except in length.  In story mode you have until a year(around 300 days) to train all your gladiators to compete in a roman championship to decide the who has the strongest gladiators. While in Endless mode you pretty much do the same thing except take out the Roman championship and thats it.  \n\nThe game can get repetetive at times and the gratification from a victory can feel shortlived I'd say its a fun enough game when it does decide to challenge you such as in the variety in arena combat.  Unlike most gladiator games you can't control your gladiators from the get go you have to \"learn\" that ability from a \"Doctore\" and although this ability is fairly easy to get your gladiator is still weak as shit so you'll have to train them nonthless to be somewhat useful.  The process to train your galdiators is somewhat boring since all you have to do it modify a slider on their character screen and right click on them until they train in that ability and usually this process takes forever.  There is a way to get around this and thats the combat, whenever you win a fight you rewards are as follows: Gold, Water,Food,Wine,Jupiter cards,and Slaves but along with these rewards you will also gain increases in your gladiator's abilities, depending on which one was used to fight (and survived) while this is incentive to fight more often your gladiators can also die losing all the progress you had with that gladiator or you can make them surrender and then they'll only lose their morale, health(which can be healed same as morale), and their equipment.  The way your gladiator loses can seem a bit heavy handed but i does little to gameplay you still have the same stats and other than the equipment you dont really lose anything longterm.  \n\nOverall I like the game as a quick arcade game that offers a quick fix in fun in terms of building up and managing a team of gladiators, but falls short in terms of replayability.  Maybe if there were some sort of rare loot drop aside from the jupiter cards like rare equipment and heavier consequences to your gladiators after each loss I'd play this game longer but other than that I can't recommend this game unless its on sale.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "32831393", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498512533, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498507248, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073529857", "playtime_forever": 143, "last_played": 1498507128, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Fast paced and super fun game.

Fortune favoured this man indeed; a force to be reckoned with. \n\nHe defeated every foe I put before him, he dominated entire enemy squads almost single handedly.  \nRarely would an oponent survive 3 blows from this man. \n\nHe even carried the team through 2 tough boss fights.   \n\nWhen he apealed for his freedom I could not deny him. He had given me MORE than enough in his time of service. \nIt was a real shame to lose him and a blow to my team, but he had earned it. The rest needed to see that freedom was indeed 'attainable'. \n\nI found a new 'Ace in the hole' in another man (or so I thought); this time a cheap slave from the magister. This one caught my eye due to his extraordinarily high health pool. \nHis name was Mallius, and unlike his predecessor, THIS son of a b**** only ever had ONE victory through his entire career. \n\nThis may not seem like much of an achievement yet, but allow me to clarify.   Malluis probably fought more battles than the first guy, infact one of his first was WITH the origional 'Champion' as an 8v8; only 3 of my men survived that battle. \n\nMallius probably had around 6 individual 1v1 fights, only one of which was a victory, his ONLY victory. \nTo spite becoming the strongest man in my force, HE LOST A LOT...    But he never died; even after losing a feirce boss fight.\n\nHe appealed for release about 3-4 times (more than anyone else), all of which were denied.  I was determined for him to become my next 'Great Champion' before I granted his freedom, he had to EARN it. \n\nIn retrospect, what Mallius didnt give me through victory, he gave me through suffering.  \n\nI can hardly recall how many brushes with death he had, and the only thing more impossible than having him win, was rasing his mood. \nMore than anything else, Mallius was miserable; he served me in this state through the majority of the year. \n\nAfter all he had been through, in the end he was never given his freedom, no. Unlike my previous champion; Mallius TOOK his freedom, rather than recieving it. \n\nOne night, a week or so before the final championship, he managed to escape. Fortune favoured him one last time, and he once again narrowly escaped death, as everyone else (including myself) was brutally slaughtered in the next and final event. \n\nYet HE remains alive out there somwhere...

My experience was... less than optimal.\n\nTLDR: I heard abysmal things about this game. Praises, but with HEAVY drawbacks. I figured it was just people being their usual judgemental selves. This game disappointed me, and I do not feel it is worth purchasing at all. It feels to have the level of gameplay quality of a free flash game from three years ago, with higher music/production quality.\n\nNow, the music? It's fucking amazing. And the graphics are servicable. My real problem was with the difficulty. And no, not that it was 'too hard'. \n\nI like to play games on 'normal' difficulty, going in for whatever ups and downs that means. Turns out, that made for a pretty engaging game. In normal mode. But, you see, I've never been a fan of timed games. And I never knew this game had a time limit before buying it. So, I thought, 'Man, this would be perfect if not for that one-year time limit.' \n\nLucky for me, there was an endless mode. Unlucky for me, endless mode means that you start at up-scaled difficulty. You begin with base-line fighters. Almost no experience, moderate gear, and variable stats. The fist TEN enemies I faced in endless mode where all incredibly experienced, absurdly geared up, highly skilled fighters.\n\nMaybe that's a bug, yeah? So I restarted. Tried the same first half-dozen or more fights a few more times. Fiddled with the difficulty slider.\n\nSo, as it turns out, the difficulty slider does literally nothing. Like, LITERALLY nothing. Not being hyperbolic here. It changed NOTHING. That's when I returned the game. \n\nAs an after-word, I have played and mastered many incredibly challenging games. Though this one feels much more like random chance than most any of the others. And not the 'exciting' sort of random chance, either. And I'm definitely not one to usually bitch and moan about chance, I love challenging chance-friendly games (See Enter The Gungeon and Darkest Dungeon) yet this one just... there was NO skill involved. It was just legitimately impossible.\n\nAlso, I understand that there's a literal 'AI intelligence' stat, but I didn't realize it was going to be so literal. Clumping together so that they can all be one-shot at once is definitely NOT what was advertized in the videos on here.

Simple enough, but there is no cap, and it leads to an absurd situation when your defense is greater than their attack: You take zero damage, no matter how many enemy gladiators come at you. A super gladiator outstats the enemies so he takes 0 damage and can kill dozens of enemies without taking damage. Because he takes no damage, he can fight over and over, every single day, winning and getting even more stats to be even more absurd. This undermines almost all of the game's core mechanics, like the combat system, dodging/blocking, managing gladiators, using lesser skilled gladiators, finding items, deciding what to upgrade, etc. Even on the highest difficulty, and even with my top gladiator running away, the game is trivially easy.\n\nYou might be thinking, \"Just don't play that way, then, it's a single player game.\" Except the damage formula works the other way, too. Gladiators you hire or find in the arena, or slaves you rescue, etc. don't have enough stats to compete and do zero damage.

The problem is that now it's super boring.  He's like a super warrior that can cut down 5 gladiators in less than 3 seconds and which looks like one hit.  I always put him 1 vs 5.  I don't remember his level but his HP is over 2000.  It was cool at first but.......ummm yeah I'm looking for my next fix.  Game is worth $4.98 and not a penny more.  I suggest watching some one play it on twitch for an hour.  Trust me because after the first initial hype the game turns to a app game.  Also you probably won't even get to control your fighters because you'll lose 90% of the time until you get a guy super maxed out.\n\n\n\n(FIRST REVIEW)\n\nGame started out really fun until you see how unbalance it is.   Every play through is different so far but the problem I had was the mini story.  I died after from making a random choice from a list of possible 4 answers.   This was after I put in so much time into my top 3 gladiators.  They were the best but just like that it said my game was over..................................................................................................................................... I stared at the screen in disbelief..........................................................I looked for a load button............................................................................................................................................. oooooooooooookay......  :starts a new game:   Ditched the first mode and tried the never ending mode...  Still not even sure if you can die from making a decision or not.   Anyhow I built this gladiator up to level 68 strength giving him over 400 HP.   Had great armor and the best sword..  HE F'N DIED from 4 hits!!!  From a lesser Gladiator!!!!    WTF!!!!!?????    (sighs)  calms down.   \n\n3rd try................. My first guys are preping for their first battles......short story all of them lost their first fight to lesser gladiators with lower stats everywhere.  The last one I controlled.

It looks nice, has style, it seems to have management depth, and cool combat you can either watch or partcipate in. Just reviewing the main mode here, Domina is probably the most poorly balanced commercial single player game I have ever or will ever see. The gameplay is based around building a 'one-punch' man, and it's as easy as setting two skills to be trained and buying armor. By about the second or third fight, your first gladiator is unbeatable. Heal him up, and he'll be good to go even on reduced health for the next fight. And then you just click the slaves you gained from the fights to train them the same way, although you'll probably not have to use them, except as a distraction. Rinse and repeat until the 365 day length of the game is up.\n\nThat took me almost three hours, and I can see a lot of people who gave it a 'recommend' didn't even play it for that long. Curious, because I would go back and play it more, to get the best ending (unless I'm mistaken and there isn't one), or try what appeared to be three other modes (longer fights mode, and endless mode, as well as a difficulty slider). In any case, I played for long enough to see that there's no depth to the three very easy to get resources, or the skill training and skill tree, both of which are useless compared to the stats gained from ending a fight. The factions, two characters (who can be replaced throughout the playthrough, resetting their alignment bars) don't seem to do much beyond giving an extra place to recruit units, or, rarely, a source of some extra income. There's only the illusion of depth here, and it's convincing enough for someone who hasn't played the game.\n\nThe combat itself is hectic and fastpaced to the point where it's impossible to tell what's going on, especially when characters can easily be wearing the same armor. It's very slidy and floaty, and then by the endgame characters are dashing across the screen in a single stride to deal massive damage. Not in a fun way, even, unless you're controlling a really overpowered guy. Very odd decisions there, seems very amatuerish. As if the developer said, \"yeah, that'll work\" and left off making it substatial or excusable as physically possible. Also, it slows down very easily. I felt more like I was playing on a Sega Genesis when 24 people on the screen at once caused the game to scream in pain, and flash, and chug.   \n\nThe music is just all over the place. It's sort of cyber-punk, 1980's, and then it goes into this kind of generic adventure music, and then back into something that would seem to belong in Stardew Valley. I'm absolutely confused.\n\nAll-in-all, it's cheap little game, slightly compelling experience, but doesn't offer even as much content as some of the better Flash games back in the day. This game would have been free and overlooked in the 2007 market, before Steam set up shop for indy devs, or mass positive reviewing 'Indy darlings' because 'one guy made this and it's okay' was a thing. This is a repetitive rogue-lite (or is it roguelike?) game. Even if it's only $5 (on sale), there should be something to make you stick around. I mean, I bought Crusader Kings 2 for $5. That was 300 hours of playtime. Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl? $5, and that was 30 hours. This is not a story driven game, so it's a bit disappointing that there seems to be so little to experience. \n\nI wouldn't refund this, even if it hadn't pushed the 2 hour time limit for a refund. No big loss to me that it wasn't 100% or 45% what I wanted or expected it to be, and it is a neat little idea. But I just want to say, caveat emptor. For what that's worth. I'm hoping there'll be some substatial updates that add actually substantial content and an actual attempt at gameplay balance, and if that happens, I'll change my review for sure.\n\n\nOr, just buy this game if you want to turn a Roman Gladiator into Goku, becuase this is basically the hyperbolic time chamber simulator. If you're looking for a character driven roguelike with some management, get or reinstall FTL instead.\n\n\nNew information: I went back and played on 'pro-gamer' mode, and it's essentially the same thing, except there's a higher likelyhood that random events will fire which will remove your best gladiators. If anything, the one-punch man becomes deadlier when there are more enemies, etc.. He just gains more stats, and it's eve very possible to build several one-punch men if you play just a little tactically. I found out, having not seen it in my first playthrough, that you can buy retinues who heal your men, auto-train them, and upgrade their gear.. Which makes the game another magnitude easier. Pit fights are another thing I missed in my first playthrough, as all of this is hidden, for some reason, in the resources menu. They're just more men to fight, which can be done every few days, and makes money and stats for gladiators very abundant. I was making about 2k gold a week at one point, and it costs about 1.8k to upgrade a gladiator to max gear.\n\nThere's a lot of people appearently, who don't realise how easy the game is for whatever reason, that it's very possible to just keep sending out the best characts and winning every time. The only feedback I've gotten so far in the comments section, negatively, despite almost 100 downvotes, is that 'I should like the game anyway, because it wasn't bad enough to refund'. No, I'd rather have spent the money on a game I enjoyed, like I could have bought Darkest Dungeon instead. Much better game that explores similar 'hardcore' concepts, and isn't secretely very easy.", "comment_count": 16, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "32769791", "weighted_vote_score": "0.677073240280151367", "votes_up": 188, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500048224, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 10}, {"timestamp_created": 1498391639, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991737447", "playtime_forever": 1180, "last_played": 1526214724, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "God damn.

I realise you can control them yourself once you have had your Doctori research \"Mind Control\" but in practice this doesn't work well either. You can have a gladiator with superior skills, training, and equipment and still lose for no apparent reason. Also I'm not a fan of how the game progresses quickly no matter what you are doing. At times it can seem as if you are not actively participating and just watching time zip along and there is no way to slow the pace. This is especially apparent in the early stages when you don't have much of a clue what you are doing. You will also randomly be expected to face a highly skilled gladiator AND lions, or several gladiators, with only a single gladiator of your own. Domina just has too many random factors to make it worthwhile and its roguelike nature makes it difficult to apply any sort of strategy before you fall behind.\n\nEven should you persevere long enough to get a gladiator or two to win most of their fights you will find that it has taken you too long to make them strong enough to beat the easiest of regional champions and your game will time out. This is, no doubt, why the \"endless\" mode was introduced but that mode always starts harder than the normal one meaning it is far more difficult to get your gladiators up to scratch.\n\nIf you have more than a few gladiators it descends into a mobile app click-everything- as-quickly-as-possible affair. In fact, there is a live or die clicker to save your fallen heroes and it doesn't work AT ALL which suggests that it was meant for the touch screen of a mobile app. In addition, there is a bug where your saved game will only load as an empty Ludus.

The game revolves around players sitting at their hub, selecting upgrade options for various features of their hub and gladiators, paying for new equipment for their gladiators, experiencing random text based events and performing various other clicking tasks. Sending their gladiators to the arena to paricipate in pit fights, arena battles and exhibitions at various timed intervals.\n\nPlayer gladiators are controlled by the computer by default, and fights are simply the player watching. However players can unlock a low cost perk in the upgrade tree which unlocks manual gladiator control. The game thus revolves around resource management, hub management, and combat or computer combat spectating, however most of the finer points of this are left completely unexplained. Making the game feel profoundly bad to play until the player naturally discovers all the various elements that they can and must control and manage. The game being a very interesting and solid gladiator management experience once this point is reached an hour or more into playing.\n\n\nThe art style and graphical quality is fantastic, the music is thrilling, the text event writing is solid and sometimes hilarious and the combat system is decent. The management side of the game also feels very balanced in that loses can be recovered, and so there is not likely to be a point where it feels like the game becomes unplayable. Losing a gladiator sucks, but it is not remotely as crippling as it is in some games where losing your character wastes tens of minutes to hours of your time.\n\nThe primary downsides to the game are the presence of multiple awkward glitches, despite the amount of fixes the game has recieved; but most of these glitches are more quirky and once identified they can be avoided decently well. The lack of a deep tutorial, which the game certainly needs, in order for players to properly understand the mechanics is a huge problem for beginners. And finally, how spastic the combat can sometimes be. The enemies in the game will sometimes just resort to spamming their attack over and over, which will usually obliterate the players gladiator even if they were already winning. The game would benefit much more if the combat was made slower, heavier, and more methodical then it currently is as at times it does feel arbitrarily spammy.\n\nIn all a good game with a strong amount of playability for those who enjoy system management.

A time-waster at best. It becomes repetitive quickly and, in my case, (with Mind Control, which allows you to directly control your gladiators) the gameplay lacked any sort of challenge or strategy. It's not a game I would personally play for longer than ten minutes at a time, but I thought I'd give it a shot for longer after buying it. It lost its charm after an hour, and the remaining 40 minutes were spent mindlessly clicking, killing combatants one after another in the games and spending the in-between bored and hoping something exciting would happen. I managed to win the 9 Championship Games without my fighter taking a single scratch and felling the combatants in mere seconds.\nI keep seeing people talk about lions being involved in combat? I didn't see a single lion. Anywhere. The most variety to a fight would be that one of the fighters would be chained to the floor or one of the fighters would be slightly larger (though no more difficult).\nMaybe that's an RNG thing, but when variety relies on RNG, that's not the mark of a good game.\nMaybe if you use it as a simulator, not getting mind control and just letting your gladiators fight with their AI, it's more fun... But at that point, you're not involved in the action. You're just another spectator. That's not gameplay, that's a glorified cage match you take no part in.\n\nIn short, it's not a game for people who want a gladitorial combat game, it's more of a game for people who want a management game. Not a game for everyone, but maybe someone else will enjoy it.\n\nA Quick Edit: I played the game on Normal for about an hour before swapping over to hard. Yes.

It's not hard to achieve the basic goal of the game and win the championship with common sense choices, but the real meat of the game is taking what you've learned after beating it once and going for the \"true\" ending afterwards... then cranking up the difficulty after you're done that!\n\nThe important feature of the game, to either let the ai fight for you or take over a slave to fight as, gives this game appeal to different types of players. Fights are fun and varied, plenty of risk to take, and meaningful choices to make make this game a solid title. Hell, there's some \"off-optimal\" choices to make if you want to try goofy strategies.\n\n[h1] Sound / Music [/h1]\n\nSounds do their job, but the game has a solid soundtrack. I find music to be important for games to set the mood, and the tracks do their job very well. Hell, I've added a couple of the songs to my own music collection! Well done.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nMight be a turn off for those with \"pixel fatigue\", but they do their job, and are presentable. Most importantly, everything is clear and only becomes a problem in the big melees.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nLearning what to do off the bat is a bit of a challenge since the game doesn't hold your hand, but once you got the basics, managing the day to day is pretty straightfoward. Don't run out of resources, don't let your vets die, win as many fights as you can. You can look up a guide if you're having problems, but I recommend learning on your own, and don't be afraid of losing the game.\n\nThe management part of the game has enough meaningful choices to keep it interesting, though once you settle on on a strategy and know exactly what you want to achieve, it can be a bit of a drudgery. The events keep you from getting bored at least.\n\nThe battle themselves are simple and aren't paticullarly deep, but it can be fun to jump in as a fighter and go for it. Even better when you know combat tricks and go in as a stock standard slave with no gear and pull up a win anyways! \n\n[h1] Technical Issues and Asides [/h1]\n\nMain ones I found are if you move a slave from one space to the next while paused in the management part of the game, you have to unpause before you can select it again. Kinda annoying if you're like me and like to sort your slaves by veterancy.\n\nAnother issue is slowdown during big fights, which can hitch the game and make multi-fighter fights a big death ball where everyone dies in 3 seconds. Careful with this one!\n\nNo other technical issues that were blatant. Pretty good game in this department overall.\n\nAside: there's an option to turn off the profanity in the crowd speech. I'm glad this was there, because I found the excessive profanity lines rather annoying to listen to.\n\nThe tone and humour in the game is spot on otherwise.\n\nOne more thing: there's cheese strats in the game for you to abuse, but that's ok because PRO GAMER MODE.\n\n[h1] In Closing [/h1]\n\nGame is very much worth the price point, even without the current Summer Sale.", "comment_count": 3, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32720110", "weighted_vote_score": "0.972463369369506836", "votes_up": 669, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498299170, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 13}, {"timestamp_created": 1498294063, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028135615", "playtime_forever": 322, "last_played": 1498292186, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Pretty much like punch club.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "32717539", "weighted_vote_score": "0.273474335670471191", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498294063, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498292901, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108774777", "playtime_forever": 605, "last_played": 1526567221, "num_reviews": 157, "num_games_owned": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "===[ Graphics ]=== \n\u2610 Pure dogshit\n\u2610 Terrible\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2611 Good \n\u2610 Beautiful \n\u2610 Exceptional\n\n===[Price/quality: ]=== \n\u2611 Full price \n\u2610 Wait for sale \n\u2610 Free\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Stay away\n\n===[ Requirments: ]=== \n\u2610 90' PC\n\u2610 Minimum\n\u2611 Medium \n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end \n\u2610 Beastly\n\n===[ Difficulty: ]=== \n\u2610 Difficult to lose \n\u2610 Rather easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master \n\u2611 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n===[ Game time/length ]=== \n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2611 Short ( 2 - 6 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours ( 6 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2610 Endless\n\n===[ Story] === \n\u2610 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Adam Sandler bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n===[ Bugs ]=== \n\u2610 Barely- if at all, runs\n\u2610 Everywhere\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2610 Few Bugs (Not game breaking)\n\u2611 Nothing\n\n===[ Overall ]===\n\u2610 Burn it with fire\n\u2610 Terrible\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Ok\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Nice\n\u2610 Perfect\n\nIf you like my reviews then please consider joining my curator group\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/CurateMeister\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32716957", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1521315804, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498285555, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122595464", "playtime_forever": 734, "last_played": 1499920808, "num_reviews": 72, "num_games_owned": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Very fun game, a bit short, would like to see more features and gameplay, make it a bit longer...\nRecommanded!\n\nFair price point, 10$", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32713599", "weighted_vote_score": "0.529220819473266602", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498285555, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1498281500, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090931738", "playtime_forever": 206, "last_played": 1498280976, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Clever game.

I couldn't disagree more, there are multiple ways to play the game depending on who you hire into your ludis (as you have a limited number of slots) you have to hire and fire to get different ppl at different times and each has a unique effect.  It is more like a rogue like in the way that you'll play multiple play throughs different ways (or similar ways) and have different experiences. \n\nI have not played since the chariots that are supposedly in there  but seeing it on the front page and redoing my reivew I think I'm going to go fire it back up. \n\nOld review: Ultimate Roguelike Gladiator Simulator.\n\nAfter a couple more play throughs I have to say I thoroughly love this game. \n\nOld Old review:\n\nWow, I was looking for a gladiator game for a long time.  This looked promising, it blew my expectations out of the water.  I was expecting a quick arcade brawler for 10 bucks, but it's so much more than that.  The limited room for all the different upgrade ppl you can hire alone seems to lend to infinitate replayability. \n\nMy biggest gripe right now is pretty small.  On the world map you have to deafeat ppl to prove your worth, the only problem I have with this whole system is that ... most the ppl you have to beat on the world map are known for really weird acts of animal cruelty in weird situations.  I realize this is probably all randomly generated but I'd still rather these great gladiators I have to go beat be known for acts of amazing martial prowess or heroic acts in battle ...

Like no matter what, I could not for the life of me last ten minutes, even on easy. Turns out, it just has a very harsh learning curve. \n\nLet me save you some headache; soon as your campaign starts, pause it, grab the monk, pray to Mars, and set everyone to meditate. This raises the AI's overall smartness, so your gladiators will be better at knowing how to time offense vs. defense. \n\nMy only main issues now are that there is even a defacto best setup when it comes to your employees, which severely limits how you can go about your base building which is little fun. Also given the investment time needed for units to be ready for the pit, the other two classes really ought to be unlockable earlier than they are. By the time I could make my own, they'd still take forever to prepare for the difficulty of the battles by then. \n\nFrustrations aside, it's a weirdly engrossing strategy game. It scratches a similar itch to your FTL or Darkest Dungeon, where you pray for the best, and pick your units wisely. Only it's closer to the former rather than the latter, in that a party wipe means a campaign might be done for, like in DD, but like FTL, the campaign isn't meant to last you 10 hours, so it feels like less sunk time. \n\nNot to mention, the soundtrack is disgustingly good, and honestly part of the main reason I gave the game a second shot.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32140777", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496472271, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496425971, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007864729", "playtime_forever": 1479, "last_played": 1511047644, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "For $9.99, which is less than I spend on some of my meals, this game is worth the time I enjoyed from it.

I'm going to recommend it based on the idea that if it appeals to you it's not expensive and can be a lot of fun if you're looking for something fairly simple to figure out but with the option to do some min-maxing.\n\nOn the one hand, while I really want to love it for its Rogue-Like qualities, gritty setting, and the combination of approachable simplicity combined with a certain kind of depth, it's just another game which punishes you for not tricking it - and once you figure out how to trick it a lot of the enjoyment of playing goes out the window - and I'm not really sure I want to keep grinding to see if there's a happy ending.  Expect to burn a couple hours on a playthrough to learn the mechanics as the 'tutorial' is just a roadblock to features and doesn't teach you anything.\n\n*SPOILERS* below.\n\nIf you win too much, the game starts stacking the 'deck' against you with fervor.  When you're given fights against impossible odds it turns out there's no penalty for throwing 1 naked guy hopelessly against them to die - and this actually works in your favor by adding a 'loss' to your stack and forcing the AI to throw easier guys at you next fight.  So by winning the fights that matter (the unavoidable fights which you have a count down toward and which pay your small fortunes) and throwing exhibition matches (get the same favor win or lose) with the free or 3-gold slaves you get, you can always have perfect standing with the two guys who won't ever go away and never help you no matter what you do for them or how good your standings are - even in the end when you win everything and are accused of murder, they don't help you and so you (the Domina) are swarmed by gladitors as an ending....  Neat.\n\nBy favoring a few guys and letting them steamroll really easy guys in exhibition and regular fights you can get their stats really high (any victorious fighters who don't die automatically get +2 to all stats, even if they never fought).  You also never need to train the ability to train the other two gladiator types as you can just buy already trained guys if you want those classes from the freeloading Legatus on the left or as prizes.  That's all after considering that you can take an unclasses slave into the arena, dodge around until a trident is dropped in the ring, then own just about anything that comes at you with a very little training.\n\nThe resource management and items of the game are a joke.  1 gold buys 30~50 of a given supply with no details.  You start out with way too much gold, it's too easy to buy helpers and upgrade, and you get way too much gold for winning fights, but it's 'balanced' by the super inflated and nonsensical costs of different equipment upgrades, right? - all 'upgrades' are always a def/atk upgrade, but the weight changes, meaning that you'll avoid certain upgrades until you can afford to move beyond them in one go.  When it dawns on you that you can sell the gladiators you get as prizes for winning fights (the cannon fodder with zero skills but hundreds of gold in equipment) you suddenly have more gold than you can spend.  If you ever just want to buy tons of food/water you can save+exit to menu, reload, buy a 10 stack of food 5 stack of water, rinse and repeat - apparently reloading the save game resets the market stack back to new game levels without having to wait for it to restock and removes the stock maximum.\n\nInstability.  For the most part, the game is pretty stable.  No hard crashes or anything like that.  I did have to save+exit and reload my save multiple times in a single run through (2.5 hours to do) because the game would get choppy, things would lag, and saving and reloading would fix it (this is how I discovered the Food+Water exploit above).  This seemed to happen more quickly when my garrison was full or near full with lots of guys doing the training actions.  There was also some lag during larger fights (the ones I'd throw 1 or 2 unclassed slaves into against 10-14 enemies because sorry, I'm not throwing my best gladitors into a chaos melee with lag and a victory prize the same as a 1v1, which is another issue) - Prizes didn't seem to be dynamic or based on anything, it always says xxx-gold and x-slaves, then you get additional things based on, I guess, performance?  But you never see any data in an after fight summary or anything like that.\n\nI also got the \"Kill an enemy (achieve victory?) with a thrown weapon\" achievement when one of my AI gladiators 'threw' his maxed upgraded spear at a guy and killed him - it seemed more like my guy got disarmed and the spear fell on the guy and killed him...?  I hadn't researched \"throw weapon\" yet, and my guy who threw his spear didn't recover it after the fight despite surviving and being victorious (I had to rebuy the most expensive weapon because he threw it...).  Which brings me to not being able to use evasive rolling until you research it despite AI gladiators and enemies having access to it from the beginning.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32116115", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496353674, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496343967, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209814584", "playtime_forever": 1040, "last_played": 1549412291, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Love it.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32113544", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496343967, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496336925, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130281289", "playtime_forever": 445, "last_played": 1547960261, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Brilliant game, 11/10 would watch men fight for my entertainment again", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32111495", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496336925, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496329888, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023218818", "playtime_forever": 1591, "last_played": 1498762652, "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 1901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Spartacus Simulator\n\nGreat soundtrack\n\nIts worth every penny\n\n9/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32108952", "weighted_vote_score": "0.495495468378067017", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1528632445, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496324945, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388685016", "playtime_forever": 3777, "last_played": 1551776402, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11}, "review": "love this game, always fun to play", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32107482", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496324945, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496321263, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002596772", "playtime_forever": 3559, "last_played": 1527362632, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "It's nearly really good.

The suddender machnic is great, but i much as i click i cannot ever save them. maybe im dumb and just not understanding how it works but i can barly get it half way out of the \"death\" zone. so id like to ask for maybe and option to turn this off or make it easier, or just explaining it better. \n\n3. I don't know the delvopers direction or goals with this game. But id love to see different Campaigns as it were. Like maybe Achiecnt Greece, Middle east, Gaul. Like maybe you start with Barbarian slaves, and your fighting in mud pits and work your way to Rome like that. You could even make a single Gladitor Story mode, where the player controls this one guy, though events etc. I have a few ideas, but thats the basic premise.\n\nAnyway, Thank you for reading. \n\n\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32105976", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496319630, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496319327, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036504265", "playtime_forever": 858, "last_played": 1496621254, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I love this game.

I start losing matches because enemy scale better than my gladiators and because ai doesn't need to upgrade stuff and since rewards are not scaling it's quite hard to keep up with it. Also It'd be better if we could select what kind of enemy to face because in late game you have no choice but to put your best gladiators on the line cause enemy is like beast near end game and if you lose a gladiator there's no turning back and you can't train another one quickly because opponent gladiators always too \npowerful in late game.\n\nAlso Exhibition matches quite far from satisfying. I can't restrain host most of the time and magistrate and legate constantly giving me super hard matches with no rewards at all. So most of my runs I completely had to ignore them. So a dead content here. \n\nAlso, I want to be able select which type of match and what kind of difficulty I want to challange, so bigger risks bigger rewards issue. For example, If I select 1 gladiator for many vs many that'd be better If I get scaling rewards per number of enemy, or If I could defeat 5vs5 gauntlet match with only single gladiator then I should be able to get better stats reward. \n\nFor second part, The thing I'll suggest is if you can, please bring specialisation... I want to specialise my gladiators or champion. Like, it can be more weapon types or armor types, or unique armor/weapon rewards like as cards. They can be master of 2h or dual wield. or master of sword and shield. or master of stats, such as master of defence and that gladiator will unlock special training types which will allow him to gain unique perks of that mastery. For example shield bash to stagger enemy maybe...\n\nAlso that'd be great if there is fear factor for executioner type of armors. Because If I'm superior to my enemy by stats or weapon type etc... I want them to know that I'll crush them and ai should become intimidated from the devastatingly strong looking armor :D", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32028592", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496699023, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496003040, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962964920", "playtime_forever": 652, "last_played": 1549135464, "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "It's very addicting, the soundtracks are lit !\nWidhed there where a vs mode or tournament mode against other real players or something like that :D", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32028420", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496003040, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1496002798, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086661549", "playtime_forever": 639, "last_played": 1550512702, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "[h1]This Game Is Good![/h1]\nThis game is really fun and a good time waster if your waiting for a game to download or just want to releave some stress...\nIf I had to rate this game at its current state I would rate it 8/10", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32028343", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1496002798, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1495977441, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017451492", "playtime_forever": 1137, "last_played": 1547514683, "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Really good little game, and dev keeps updating and fixing so yeah it is good yo ! :D", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32019681", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1495977441, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1495969023, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018766813", "playtime_forever": 873, "last_played": 1536254828, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Every single bug and feature complaint was fixed and patched since the release of this game.\n\nThe majority of Thumbs Downs currently are for bugs that are taken care of.\n\nThe game itself is immensely hard and has incredible replay value attached to it, coupled with interesting music and atmosphere that the game creates using events and urgency to make your gladiators the Best of the Best.\n\nOne of the easiest games to recommend to gamers due to enganging gameplay, magnificent dev support and high entertainment value.", "comment_count": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "32017208", "weighted_vote_score": "0.949039161205291748", "votes_up": 332, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1495969023, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3}, {"timestamp_created": 1495956264, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008486759", "playtime_forever": 631, "last_played": 1505761308, "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Really cool.

It isnt even the net that makes them op its the blood spear. 1 shotted one of my best gladiators as if I threw a naked guy with no gear against him.\n\nGranted there was some fun times seeing my gladiator rise from a poor state to an absolute power house, however this was quickly undone by either a never ending back flipping gladiator until he swings 1 time and decapiates your tank. I do like how the matches are randomly generated because it adds some pretty fun factors. \n\nIts mostly just the damage system and the BS ninja flipping AI that ruin this for me. Maybe when this game gets further along I'll rewrite my review but as it stands this game is just pure BS.

I remember the first time I watched the chariot scene from Ben-Hur and my brother whispering to me that somebody actually died in that scene. It was like a peek into the past, starring Charlton Heston. \n\nNothing really changed as I grew up, watching Troy, 300, and Gladiator. Okay, maybe some changes like historical accuracy, acting, special effects, and way too much chest oil but they are kinda the same feeling I got as a kid.\n\nMuch to my delight, when I heard about Domina (Steam link) I was super excited. Domina puts you in charge of your own gladiator fighting team or \u201cLudus\u201d in a fun pixelated management style game. So that way you don\u2019t have to feel bad about murdering someone chained to the floor, it\u2019s pixelated! The story is short and sweet, something about your dad going bankrupt and his estate landing on your lap. The Emperor wants to have an awesome ruckus of a year with arena combat and is offering all sorts of gold, glory and fame. Opportunity is plenty and ripe for the taking, if you train your gladiators well.\n\nNormally this is when I would starting talking about features and what I think about them, but before I do that I want to talk about game development. It\u2019s hard, mmkay? Aside from that being the biggest \u201cduh\u201d of a sentence, it needs to be underlined. Why? Domina is developed by one person, not two, not one and a half. Just one. That means programming, art, music, the whole shebang lands on one guys shoulders. For my part as a reviewer, I always keep that in mind. You as a reader should too. Otherwise go make your own Indie studio and prove me wrong.\n\nDomina is best broken down into two half halves. One side is the management and the other is combat.\n\nThe game starts with offering you a tutorial and introducing each aspect of the game bit by bit. I would honestly suggest skipping this. The reason is that the tutorial really doesn\u2019t explain all that much. It introduces side characters and what they are for, but these aspects aren\u2019t as important as the gladiators themselves, which it lightly touches upon. It\u2019s also a little slow paced compared to just starting the game normally. Yes I know that\u2019s the point but it just comes off unnecessarily slow paced.\n\nDomina is a game that is meant to be beaten in about hour and a half chunks. Think FTL but with a focus on building a championship team of gladiators over a series of exhibition style bouts. It is a rather robust but simple system that has some deep strategy once you understand the basics. It took my first four games before I noticed there was a trait system that really changes combat. There are multiple facets to the game I am going to go over but it all serves the same purpose, which is your gladiators.\n\nFirst you have your city officials which are the Legate and the Magistrate. They serve two purposes for the most part. Primarily they are the ones running the local arenas and depending on how much they like you, may affect the prize or even the match style itself. Additionally they also can be used to purchase new gladiators/slaves. Additionally there are random dialogue events that can occur to make one or the other happy. Depending on what hirelings you\u2019re using or what the level of your gladiators are may change these events. It\u2019s a really neat aspect that kinda adds a roleplay, FTL element to it. You can also make them happy by drowning them in wine. It\u2019s Rome, what do you expect?\n\nUp to three hirelings can be added to your Ludus for many different purposes. They can come in many varieties from the obvious such as Medicus to heal your gladiators after a fight or the Haruspec who can make sacrifices to the gods for favour. Other choices include Architects to modify your training grounds, Educators, Bards, and Agents. They all contribute in unique ways and it\u2019s rather neat to try different strategies as you play.\n\nThere is also some minor resource management. This area is by far the weakest aspect of the game. It\u2019s really not that important other than having a steady flow of food/water/wine. Which you can buy from the market in droves. So it makes very little difference to overall gameplay long as you just keep buying the stuff. There are some hirelings to produce these resources but that would be a wasted slot in my opinion. It\u2019s something I think needs to be patched to make more relevant or just be done away with all together. \n\nThere is a card customization system that allows you to add buffs to individual gladiators. These cards can be earned from successful arena matches or pit fights. Which finally brings me to the gladiators and their plethora of customization\u2019s. I could go over every detail but I will just hit the general stuff. You build each individual gladiator up, from what stat they focus on training, class, armor, weapon, to managing their happiness. There are also traits that are randomly generated, permanent stats on each character, that make all gladiators fight a little differently. These are broken up into aggro, turtle, evasive and stamina and they are something you should pay keen attention to if you want to win this game. Which I haven\u2019t managed, yet.\n\nYou can grant gladiators freedom, sell them, put them to death. Everything about their lives is in your control. The management aspect of the game is in depth but don\u2019t let all this fool you. The UI and hirelings really simplify this process. You can get as in depth as you want but the busy work is done for you. I loved this aspect to the game and it\u2019s by far the most addicting aspect to it. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the three classes and skill tree. The gladiator system is that deep.\n\nOn the other side of the fence is combat. Which is brutal and messy in good and not so good ways. \n\nThere are two ways to head into the arena, you can control your gladiator or let the AI do its best. Both have their benefits and draw backs. One thing that they do share is that it all ends quickly. You will either die in about ten seconds or win in ten seconds. No more, no less. Controlling your gladiator might seem like it is the easiest. You can dodge, raise your shield, and the controls are very responsive. The problem is that the AI even on the easiest difficulty can rip you to shreds and knows how to do it. Keep in mind there are five difficulty levels.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s due to balancing or I just possibly suck, but the enemy AI just knows exactly how far it needs to reach to hit you. Combat proved to be extremely difficult for me and I just couldn\u2019t figure out why. I set myself up to be vastly over powered but would still often die randomly or win randomly. I couldn\u2019t spot clearly what I did to tip the combat in my favour other than smashing on the attack button. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still plenty of fun and I cheered gleefully when I cut off my enemies head or saw an arm fly off. It\u2019s still gladiator combat and watching a lion eat my gladiator is awesome.\n\nBelieve it or not I have had WAY better luck letting the AI do all the dirty work. An important note though is that there is a dedicated AI stat that needs to be maxed for this type of strategy. I got the farthest with this strategy but still would suffer an occasional stupid death from my best fighter. This is what indicates to me that there might be some sort of balancing issue. It didn\u2019t turn me off of the game because I still had fun trying new strategies and plans out. Although, again, this is on easy and I even started using guides.\n\nCheck out https://bigbossbattle.com/review-domina/ for the rest of the review!\n", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31963305", "weighted_vote_score": "0.323503732681274414", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1495763648, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1495651450, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209570503", "playtime_forever": 1816, "last_played": 1548880057, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Very fun and addicting actually somehow.

Focus on other attributes if you wnat to level up Mind Control (take control of one of the Avatars in battle). When your guys stop moving, its because they need you to click them again so they will start levelling up again. Buy Slaves or Warriors from the dirty old men. Don't run out of food or water, buy cheap, sell high. Pit your gladiators against others, don't let them die. \n\nIt's like the SIMS4. except your characters perma-die. reading books and excersizing is to make you better at removing limbs, not cooking. oh, and you set other people on fire instead of your house. And death is a mechanic in this game, not a playable character. And you build an army, instead of a family. And it's a standalone game, instead of all-that-DLC. And it's not owned by E(lectronic) A(rts) Games. and I wanted it play it for more than 8 minutes before giving it back to my silly younger cousin to have his friends who are all famous and want to sleep with him, who he made like that by not setting his cat on fire while boiling water.

Why you should buy the game;[/h1]\n\n\nI have 400h in Don't Starve on my non-steam version. 300 of that is probably paused and reading a wiki. I say this becuase I want you to understand that I love that game, I hate how you have to learn things by dying to them 4 times. This game was released with no pause, no tooltips, no save.... at least you can build up your training pit and warriors over the game and it lets you get far enough through to not feel like you're going to ... freeze to death on the first day of winter. What's with all the :Don't Starve: references at the moment?\n\nwell, I bought it, it didn't have save or pause, so I had no time to learn the game's intricacies (there is a lot of tooltip reading when you first play through to learn what everything does/is for). I was unhappy, posted some feedback on the forum, went to other games. I realised that people who spent time on the game, loved it, but I just couldn't be bothered learning-by-losing here. \n\n\nSomeone posted a topic; \"what is your feedback about the game\". people said \"needs pause, session saves and endless mode\" Lots of people said \"don't add pause please\" (lots = 1 person).\n\nOne week later, update comes out, Pause Added. Session Saves added. I reinstalled, played loved. 4 days later, another update: a couple of bugs with pause have been fixed, and Endless mode is released.\n\n\n[h1]What's cool about this game?[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Brutal visceral combat, gory deaths and a kill-cam.\n[*]A true RPG-roguelike, I think. \n[*]Play Your Way: take control and fight, or play it as a Godgame management- game\n[*]Unique, inspired mechanics.

The biggest problem that I have with this game right now is that when you get to the end if you win or lose the game is over.

There is a stat for this but I couldn't notice the difference when I trained it.\n\nThe enemy as far as I can see know every skill the Doctare can teach. The first enemy you fight rolls around like an acrobat. Something you don't learn until half way up the skil tree. By the time you do get higher up and know these moves yourself the game has taken a massive shift.\n\nThe high up weapons can oneshot anyone, armour doesn't matter. I found myself doing better with fighters in their undies so they can dodge better. No point investing in that bulky mail and shield, because you still die in one hit. I had one fight that I debuted my Murmillo in. I had trained him from the first slave I earned in the first battle. He had about 650 gold worth of armour on him and is the heavy armour class. High strength stat so he had lots of health. Just as you would expect to build that class.  One second into the fight, the enemy throws his sword at him and he dies. \n\nMy main issue is how the fights look. Gladiatorial fighting is all about the show. Two guys just randomly swinging until one dies doesn't look good. Because i'm not controlling a fighter I am a crowd member. I find the fights so boring. Hits seem to have no impact early on. Then later its the first hit wins. No theatre, no action. Thats not how to entertain a crowd. Even with the 'Brutal Fight' option on that is supposed to make the fights last longer, they are still over in seconds. \n\nI really hope that improvements are made as the concept is really interesting and I see potential in it.\nMaybe I'll give it another go in a few months.

Managing all of your gladiators involves buying their Weapons, armor, food, water, training equipment (to enhance their training gains) etc. I feel like I've invested a lot more time then I seem to have, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Granted, there have been moments when I've had my head in my hands; because my Champion who, by all means, should have won his fight with ease, ended up losing his head. The game has its ups and downs, but for its price I think it's definitely worth it.\n\nPros\n-Great Price for a game which has plenty of replayability\n-Good Management system\n-Entertaining Battles - The option to have your Gladiators play as AI, or delve in and fight yourself\n-You feel damn proud over time when you have 'CRIXUS THE UNDEFEATED GAUL' equivalents within your Gladiators\n\nCons\n-The difficulty seems to have some issues in the game. Most opponents seem to try and scale along with your strongest gladiator, which then seems to continue after your strongest dies. That means you have opponents who are are strong as what your champion used to be, and if you haven't been training equally, you're pretty much screwed\n-There is essentially a 'time limit' for the game, as you have a year of training Gladiators and fighting battles etc, before a tournament is held. If you haven't beaten at least 3 regional Champions (I can't remember what they're called, something similar) then you aren't able to enter, and you just get sent back to the main menu. All progress gone.\n\nI will say though, the game has a lot of potential if the developers continue to deliver on what the fans are asking. I've seen old reviews begging for Saving features, and it has since been implemented, its a life saver! So if the devs read this, please try and tweak the difficulty issues to be a little fairer, but primarily, make the game (or at least a seperate mode) where you can continue on infinitely! \n\nA bonus suggestion, it would be nice to have options of building up the villa which you could physically see, such as extra space for most staff, bigger training grounds etc. Potentially some bonuses for the Doctore too, to give him more influence over Gladiators, maybe even make it possible for different Doctore's to be hired, with different bonuses.\n\nOverall, the game is great fun for its price. Smaller annoyances here and there don't deter from me from this gem of a game!\n\n\nEDIT\n\nSince this review was written, many changes have been made - including an 'endless mode' which is fantastic. Devs seem to be consistently working on awesome new ideas and enhancements for this game, which is awesome to see. I still think the difficulty inbalances can be a little absurd at times, only game I've managed to rage quit numerous times on now (mainly when losing a champion in a matchup he should have won), however I now believe its probably just down to my playstyle and putting all in my eggs in one basket.

I remember the first time I watched the chariot scene from Ben-Hur and my brother whispering to me that somebody actually died in that scene. It was like a peek into the past, starring Charlton Heston. \n\nNothing really changed as I grew up, watching Troy, 300, and Gladiator. Okay, maybe some changes like historical accuracy, acting, special effects, and way too much chest oil but they are kinda the same feeling I got as a kid.\n\nMuch to my delight, when I heard about Domina (Steam link) I was super excited. Domina puts you in charge of your own gladiator fighting team or \u201cLudus\u201d in a fun pixelated management style game. So that way you don\u2019t have to feel bad about murdering someone chained to the floor, it\u2019s pixelated! The story is short and sweet, something about your dad going bankrupt and his estate landing on your lap. The Emperor wants to have an awesome ruckus of a year with arena combat and is offering all sorts of gold, glory and fame. Opportunity is plenty and ripe for the taking, if you train your gladiators well.\n\nNormally this is when I would starting talking about features and what I think about them, but before I do that I want to talk about game development. It\u2019s hard, mmkay? Aside from that being the biggest \u201cduh\u201d of a sentence, it needs to be underlined. Why? Domina is developed by one person, not two, not one and a half. Just one. That means programming, art, music, the whole shebang lands on one guys shoulders. For my part as a reviewer, I always keep that in mind. You as a reader should too. Otherwise go make your own Indie studio and prove me wrong.\n\nDomina is best broken down into two half halves. One side is the management and the other is combat.\n\nThe game starts with offering you a tutorial and introducing each aspect of the game bit by bit. I would honestly suggest skipping this. The reason is that the tutorial really doesn\u2019t explain all that much. It introduces side characters and what they are for, but these aspects aren\u2019t as important as the gladiators themselves, which it lightly touches upon. It\u2019s also a little slow paced compared to just starting the game normally. Yes I know that\u2019s the point but it just comes off unnecessarily slow paced.\n\nDomina is a game that is meant to be beaten in about hour and a half chunks. Think FTL but with a focus on building a championship team of gladiators over a series of exhibition style bouts. It is a rather robust but simple system that has some deep strategy once you understand the basics. It took  my first four games before I noticed there was a trait system that really changes combat. There are multiple facets to the game I am going to go over but it all serves the same purpose, which is your gladiators.\n\nFirst you have your city officials which are the Legate and the Magistrate. They serve two purposes for the most part. Primarily they are the ones running the local arenas and depending on how much they like you, may affect the prize or even the match style itself. Additionally they also can be used to purchase new gladiators/slaves. Additionally there are random dialogue events that can occur to make one or the other happy. Depending on what hirelings you\u2019re using or what the level of your gladiators are may change these events. It\u2019s a really neat aspect that kinda adds a roleplay, FTL element to it. You can also make them happy by drowning them in wine. It\u2019s Rome, what do you expect?\n\nUp to three hirelings can be added to your Ludus for many different purposes. They can come in many varieties from the obvious such as Medicus to heal your gladiators after a fight or the Haruspec who can make sacrifices to the gods for favour. Other choices include Architects to modify your training grounds, Educators, Bards, and Agents. They all contribute in unique ways and it\u2019s rather neat to try different strategies as you play.\n\nThere is also some minor resource management. This area is by far the weakest aspect of the game. It\u2019s really not that important other than having a steady flow of food/water/wine. Which you can buy from the market in droves. So it makes very little difference to overall gameplay long as you just keep buying the stuff. There are some hirelings to produce these resources but that would be a wasted slot in my opinion. It\u2019s something I think needs to be patched to make more relevant or just be done away with all together. \n\nThere is a card customization system that allows you to add buffs to individual gladiators. These cards can be earned from successful arena matches or pit fights. Which finally brings me to the gladiators and their plethora of customization\u2019s. I could go over every detail but I will just hit the general stuff. You build each individual gladiator up, from what stat they focus on training, class, armor, weapon, to managing their happiness. There are also traits that are randomly generated, permanent stats on each character, that make all gladiators fight a little differently. These are broken up into aggro, turtle, evasive and stamina and they are something you should pay keen attention to if you want to win this game. Which I haven\u2019t managed, yet.\n\nYou can grant gladiators freedom, sell them, put them to death. Everything about their lives is in your control. The management aspect of the game is in depth but don\u2019t let all this fool you. The UI and hirelings really simplify this process. You can get as in depth as you want but the busy work is done for you. I loved this aspect to the game and it\u2019s by far the most addicting aspect to it. I haven\u2019t even mentioned the three classes and skill tree. The gladiator system is that deep.\n\nOn the other side of the fence is combat. Which is brutal and messy in good and not so good ways. \n\nThere are two ways to head into the arena, you can control your gladiator or let the AI do its best. Both have their benefits and draw backs. One thing that they do share is that it all ends quickly. You will either die in about ten seconds or win in ten seconds. No more, no less. Controlling your gladiator might seem like it is the easiest. You can dodge, raise your shield, and the controls are very responsive. The problem is that the AI even on the easiest difficulty can rip you to shreds and knows how to do it. Keep in mind there are five difficulty levels.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s due to balancing or I just possibly suck, but the enemy AI just knows exactly how far it needs to reach to hit you. Combat proved to be extremely difficult for me and I just couldn\u2019t figure out why. I set myself up to be vastly over powered but would still often die randomly or win randomly. I couldn\u2019t spot clearly what I did to tip the combat in my favour other than smashing on the attack button. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still plenty of fun and I cheered gleefully when I cut off my enemies head or saw an arm fly off. It\u2019s still gladiator combat and watching a lion eat my gladiator is awesome.\n\nBelieve it or not I have had WAY better luck letting the AI do all the dirty work. An important note though is that there is a dedicated AI stat that needs to be maxed for this type of strategy. I got the farthest with this strategy but still would suffer an occasional stupid death from my best fighter. This is what indicates to me that there might be some sort of balancing issue. It didn\u2019t turn me off of the game because I still had fun trying new strategies and plans out. Although, again, this is on easy and I even started using guides.\n\nCheck out https://bigbossbattle.com/review-domina/ for the rest of the review!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31536994", "weighted_vote_score": "0.667692720890045166", "votes_up": 33, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1493882163, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3}, {"timestamp_created": 1493865428, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133611758", "playtime_forever": 598, "last_played": 1492993176, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "[h1] Just my Casual Review of a game I recomend\t[/h1]\n\n[b] This is a True Rouge-Like game, and it somewhat reminds me of FTL: Faster Than Light\t[/b]\n\nLets make this a Pro and Con list, and I'll try to stay as Un-biased as I can.\n\nPro's\n+Nice Pixel art\n+You can make your own Choices during in-game events\n+Quite a few in-game events, and there will be more added\n+Saving Feature that works just fine\n+Its Price is Nice\n+Aceptable Replayability \n+Nice Combat system with ballence to it\n+Awsome Dev who is Honest with the community\n[spoiler] +Hidden secret's all over inside the game, hey I warned you!\t[/spoiler]\n+Challenging\nThis one I want to talk about some more, because some people may say that is to challenging, and this is why it relates to FTL so well. \n\nCon's\n-Optimization isnt the best, but the Dev is working on that luckily\n-Odd Glatiator control the first time you try it\n-Overwhelming at first\n\nNetrual (I can't make this a Pro or a Con)\n1.)

It has an incredible amount of depth and is hopelessly addicting once you get into it.  This is very much a \"roguelike\" game where you're furiously heading for a \"final dungeon\" and any misstep can be the difference between success and failure.\n\nThe game meshes the best parts of a \"tycoon\" simulator with roguelike games.  The best way I can describe it is \"FTL\" meets \"Darkest Dungeon\" set in Ancient Rome.  The game is all about training up gladiators to send them into fights, and with the A.I. controlling both your Gladiators and the enemy, you never know what is going to happen when the combatants enter the arena.  Sprinkle in elements of resource management, politics, upgrades, and random events, and you get a game that never fails to both entertain and frustrate on extreme levels.\n\nDomina is a game you will rage quit frequently, especially when a Gladiator you've sunk a ton of time and money into unexpectedly gets killed or runs away, leaving you high and dry.  However, once you learn the ins-and-outs of the game, you'll begin to enjoy it's core gameplay and become addicted to it, even if you still get frustrated every now and again.  But this also means each game session is unique and fun.\n\nThere is still much that can be done with this game, and hopefully the developer continues to improve it.  But as it stands, Domina is a fun and addictive game that I've sunk more hours into than I care to admit.  I'm very happy that I purchased it and gave it a shot.

The premise is you will get slaves you can train to use as gladiators in an arena to fight other gladiators with the potential to win money and other smaller prizes with which you can upgrade your current gladiators to fight better in the next battle, keep your gladiators well fed and watered, bribe officials and the like, and buy new slaves and/ or soldiers to use as new gladiators. \n\nPros: \n-Really good and refershing concept for a game. \n-Some of the BEST in game music, 10/10, up there with DOOM 2016 (in my opinion)\n-Graphics looks awesome, a great pixle art game.\n-Its fun to get into and try to figure out, ( I know, sounds weird to say, but I enjoyed figuring things out by my self and strategizing in-between fights)\n\nCons:\n-Even after you start to figure out the game, there is no way to turn down the difficulty enough for a begginer play trying to get through their first play through. \n-Really quickly you figure out that *IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU DO, YOU WILL LOOSE EVERYTHING FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THE GAME HATES YOU*. Real talk here though folks, the game is all randomly generated and not very well so theres a lot of times where you will just loose and you will be sitting there looking at your screen thinking \"What in the name of Holy Batman just f*cking happened...\"\n-There needs to be more than one kind of playthrough. There's only one game type which is seriously short, and its pretty lame because of the time limit mixed with randomly generated bullsh*t numbers, your game will end too fast too soon and leave a bitter taste in your mouth because all the time you just sank into the game will feel like it was for nothing.\n\nI could go on a little more, but I think that ultimately there needs to be some more, I mean, a LOT more, development put into the game before releasing it for any kind of money. It feels like its still in its early access stage and I would be pretty dissapointed if the devs left the game in its current state without fixing some issues and adding more content.\n\nI'm going to hold onto the game in case the devs add more and fix some stuff, I just dont think the game is worth buying right now.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "31498146", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1493689378, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 1}, {"timestamp_created": 1493671730, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067062204", "playtime_forever": 2561, "last_played": 1493477753, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "For starts, I just want to say one thing (emphatically): this game is great. Everybody should play this game.\n\nThat said, here are a few more things:\n\nDomina is a high-wire/nail-biter roguelike sim that sort of plays like the illegitimate child of Oregon Trail and Hotline Miami, if OT and HM broke into Sid Meier's house and conceived their forbidden lovechild in his garage while under the influence of LSD. \n\n(When I invoke Oregon Trail, I mean to conjure your most painful, rage-quit-inducing memories of Sally getting dysentery in Idaho and blowing away an hour or more of your \"perfect game\" progress like it was nothing. Similiarly, I suggest Hotline Miami because I want you to remember its masked, homicidal maniacs windmilling melee weapons and spilling gallons of pixel-y blood like they just huffed their weight in bath salts. The reason they're coupling in Sid Meier's garage without his knowledge is because, while there's some classical, society-building aesthetics in Domina, this definitely ain't your daddy's Civ-sim.)\n\nIt is not at all uncommon to get an hour into a new game of Domina, make a bad call about the potential risk associated with a given decision and basically wipe your game and have to start fresh, because there is literally no way you can come back from the loss within the time remaining. Moreover, when this happens, it will be in the blink of an eye: your stock will go from \"promising\" to \"junk\" in three to five glorious, horrifying, blood-drenched seconds.\n\nWhen this happens, it is awesome. Horrifying and gut-wrenching, obviously, but also totally, totally awesome. I have literally broken a sweat playing this game, due to the sheer terror of moments like these.\n\nAnd I have done this again and again, because (see above), this game is great.\n\nEverybody should play this game.\n\n\nPS: I liked Domina more before it had a save feature--no save, hardcore/OG Rogue style made the horrifying lows that much more intense--but I understand that, as an independent developer, when RPS specifically calls you out for a feature, you kind of have make something happen there. Save or no save, you should definitely play this game.\n\nPPS: the soundtrack is dope. Believe the hype.\n\nPPPS: my homeboy bought me a copy of this game and I'm going to go return the favor, because that's how much I like this game.

Very frequent updates patching and fixing things.\n\nI imagine you saw other reviews covering the basics; here's what this game needs:\n\n- No limited time frame. Allow me to play the game slowly if I wish. Especially with the very strong champions (maybe I am playing the game wrong; but at least give me the option to play in one save as long as I wish - especially whith the new auto-save feature which works great.)\n\n- A bit more optimization; but if you have everything going on automatically you won't notice much.\n\n- When I have a \"One-trick\" gladiator which does it all, the game act's as if all my gladiators are as strong. What this means is that the costs of already trained slaves from the Legate sky-rocket (as well as their equipment and stats obviously). That means I get offered 900-1200G gladiotors when really I have 300G in my pocket. This also means that when I I have 7VS7 it's very unbalanced.\n\n- Make pit fights actually sketchy as heck. Sketchier should be the word (No surrender at all for example).\n\nNOTE: as expected RNG plays a BIG factor in the game; people need to analyze stats before getting into a fight.\n\nKeep up the great work patching and fixing the game.

At the start of the game you start with only a single gladiator class unlocked, and the other two are fairly high up the skill tree. After a good fifteen play-throughs I can say I really wish some skill unlocks (like classes) were permanent unlocks. Other than some repetitive issues I have with the training gameplay loop, and the RNG heavy card system, I really don't have much to complain about.\n\nThe twitch integration is amazing, letting an audience increase your cash reward, vote on random events, and determine if surrendering gladiators live or die adds a level of interaction with an audience you rarely see, and definitely earns some extra marks.

Ever wanted to run your own ludus? Ever wanted a game where the dev is constantly improving it? \n***THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!****\n\nQuick Review:\nThe game is great for what it is (gladiator managment simulator) it has you on the edge of your seat cheering on your own gladiators because you have become attached to them or because you just cant afford a loss! The game has \"political\" choices you must make or you will soon be at your end! It has GLADIATORS it has LIONS it has BLOOD it has SAND! It also implements cool extra features like being able to control your gladiators in the arena, upgrading your lutus, hireing staff and BEING ABLE TO SAVE!! Note that there are a few bugs here and there but the dev has been working them out as quick as possible! \n\nWhat the game does not have is an endless mode... Which I would really like to see implemented as at the end of the year the game ends, win or loose! I would love to sink hours into an endless mode that gets progressively harder and see how long I can make it in the gladiator business! \n\nBUY IT?\nYES!!!!! In its current state in my opinion if you like gladiators this game IS WORTH the buy at full price! \n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\nHowever there is lots of room for improvement and I hope the dev keeps up the good work! NOTE: I would actually pay for DLCs to help support the dev of the game (as long as it goes in the right direction) AKA- Endless mode, more animals, more interatcions like chariots horses, and weapons! More ways to loose, more upgrades to your villa and what I think would be super cool (in endless mode) is if you got to create your own charactor and parhaps more family managment?", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31398459", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1493315464, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1493312489, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089818381", "playtime_forever": 1870, "last_played": 1531686175, "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Gladiator games have come and gone over the years, but few leave a standing impression or the desire for more.  Domina reaches a tycoon-simulation niche that has yet to be explored by gladiator styled games, and it does so extremely well. \n\nThe graphics are deceptively simple, yet that is what makes them so beautiful to look at.  A simple color palette ensures that the eye is not overwhelmed by too much stimuli and the sprites for the characters are very well executed. \nThis game is violent, full of sex, and debauchery'; what else would you expect of a simulation game trying to capture that blood and sand feel of Rome?\n\n With various rogue-like elements twisted in with an unforgiving autosave system you should be prepared to lose your favorite gladiator (or twelve).  But as rogue-likes do, with the horrifying comes some spectacular moments such as when a random event gifted me a lion to use in the arena.  It was beautiful. \n\nOne thing I do not like about this game is that it is too short.  The story of trying to train a team for the championship in Rome feels rushed, and really detracts from the better elements of the game.  That being said, if I finish a game and want more, the developer has done his job.   Yet the developer has not finished yet!  Updates are released every few days or so for bug fixes and such, and you can always opt in for the unstable beta.  The dev has even reached out on steam and asked fans what they want from the game, something not done too often with indie titles. \n\nIf you want a quick, unforgiving, brutal, bloody rogue-like then I would suggest Domina to you.

Updated May 25th, 2017\n\nHere's a pastebin of my original complaints. https://pastebin.com/rQ6XbYvD\n\nSo let's see what's changed.\n\nThe game is still tedious when it comes to tasks you must perform. For one thing, when you first start a game, there are a number of things you must immediately do or you'll be in a bad position within a few days. The good news is, the developer added a pause button feature and it works well! I say the tedium itself needs to be tackled, but at least I'm not having to frantically click around and I can take my time to figure out what comes next. It's something!~\n\n0. Sigh... no I don't want to do the tutorial... stop asking me every single time. (To dev... give me an option to disable this prompt, thanks.)\n1. Pause the game. Instantly. Every time.\n2. Go to the Doctore. Click the first option for research, make sure to tick 'gladiators train automatically.\" (To dev: This should be enabled by default. Unless you're doing a weird challenge run, why wouldn't players want their gladiators training? It's not like it costs anything to do so.)\n3. Sell your third gladiator. Move the other two wherever you want in the Ludus. (I like to line them up by strongest to weakest.) The reason for selling the gladiator will be explained in a few more sections.\n4. Make sure both of your gladiators are set to train their AI at max. This is super important. Once this reaches 100 after a few matches, then start training them in other stats however you want.\n5. Check your jupiter cards. If you have a bad start, you should probably reset. Actually, I usually do this first since your starting card can make or break the game. Anyway, if the card is good, toss it on your best gladiator.\n6. Upgrade your main gladiator's weapon to max, then his armor however you like, but not to max. Pay attention to prices.\n7. Hire the staff you'll need. I always start with blacksmith, architect, and then the third one is whatever I feel like.\n8. Remember that third gladiator you sold? Now buy a bunch of wine, drop all of it on the magistrate or the legate, and have them sponsor a gladiator. If they sponsor your main one, great! If they don't, you'll be buying wine with the remaining two days before the first battle starts buying wine, then plying the other guy with it, and having him sponsor your main gladiator.\n9. Make sure the staff you hired are building or training what you need.\n10. Drop leftover wine on your gladiators. It gives them free stat and morale boosts up to a limit, so why not? This can only be done once per gladiator so just drop wine on them until their stats stop going up.\n\nI do these steps every single time I start a game, and I have to do them. They're tedious and annoying and repetitive.\n\nDespite that, the addition of a pause feature is super important. I still feel like the combat is crazy fast, but I'm currently replaying the game to see what other areas the developer has adjusted. I will edit this review as I continue to play.

The sword and shield fighter is good early in game but more or less useless at the end. The twohanded wielder if not controlled by the player often gets in too deep, too fast and dies because of the lack of a shield. The trident guy is just op!

My champion Nonnius whom I had trained from day one on finished the dualwielding guy with a final crit roll after 28 victories, what a beast!

You start with 3 slaves, a trainer, and some supplies.  You then must train your starting slaves and get them ready to face the pits.  You can hire up to three different employees which can change the way your minions are trained, ranging from a blacksmith that will make equipment cheaper and repair it as well as upgrade gear slowly for free, a doctor that heals wounded gladiators automatically and much faster than on their own, an arcitect that builds various upgrades, a bard that boosts moral, a goat farmer that produces food, etc etc.\n\nThe tech tree is nice and robust, giving you more and more and more of an edge in combat, as well as the option to personally control a gladiator if you fancy your chances.\n\nSome nit-picking... the stats are poorly explained in the tutorial with zero emphasis on 'what does meditation' mean.  It's a stat that dirrectly controls how effective your gladiators are able to fight when AI controls them.  It starts at 0 out of 100.  It's by far the most important stat when letting gladiators fight on their own... and not mentioning that is kind of frustrating and adds to the learning curve.\n\nThe graphics are nice, the twitch support is a good touch.

I still love it whenever the music drops the beat after the countdown to the start of a match, it's a really nice touch.\n\n While it still has a few issues: Senator and Legate support seems rather ignorable, and specialized gladitorial fights such as group fights, beast fights, and free for alls seem fairly uncommon and rare, with the latter even being non-existent, the game itself is enough fun in its current state that the cheap price worth it. The constant updates are also a huge plus for the game's future.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31268415", "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492748189, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1492737871, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111075761", "playtime_forever": 874, "last_played": 1545367678, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Fun game.

There is no progression game to game, which is fine for me.\nI played on Mild difficulty and still lost many times before I was even able to beat more than 3+ Regionals (to fight the last boss)\nLittle did I know that the [spoiler] last fight is not the end. Hope you were kind to your fighters. [/spoiler]\n\nThe game is paced a little too quickly I feel for the requirements to actually beat the game. I would have liked a bit more time in order to prepare. \n\nBalance is fucked tbh.\nRegular gladiators (sword and shield) are alright\nThe duel wield guys are too weak vs certain characters.\n\nThe spear gladiator aka Secutor's are way overpowered, so much so that there is basically no point in any other strategy than to rush Secutor research, kit out a few, and level straight into weapons and agility/defense.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nThis one is nearly a deal breaker, it spoils a minor part of the end of the game.\n\n[spoiler] At the end of the game, you get to take up to 15 gladiators into the final combat if you were able to beat three regional champions. I did this and steam rolled the last fight with only 6 Gladiators on mild difficulty. However, after this, you have to fight with your actual character (50 HP, a shitty little gladius that does 75 damage and no armor) BUT you get all the gladiators you freed to help you. BUT NOT THE SURVIVING ONES FROM THE LAST FIGHT! So all my bad ass guys that survived the final fight, didn't fight with me in the \"final fight\" leading to a slightly salty game over.

Now on to the game...\n\n[h1]The Game[/h1]\nI personally love this game, I've only put 20 hours into it but life stuff got in the way, as well as other games.\n\nNow, what kind of audience is this game tailored towards?\n\n-People who want to manage gladiators\n-People who want to spectate bloody gladiator fights\n-People with a sick sense of humor and want to roleplay as a Daedric prince and have your own champions as pawns in your bloodsport games but because such a game doesn't really exist and using console commands in skyrim isn't enough, this game certainly satisfies that craving (example: Have a champion you love? Provide him with good equipment and the good Jupiter's blessings. Have a champion that failed you? strip his weapon, strip him down to his shorts and chuck him into the pit.)\n-People who want to be a gladiator (Yes!!!! You can totally just tech up the mind control training and treat this game like a hack n slash game!!!\n-People who come from [b]Salty bets[/b] but want more control\n\n-And lastly, people who want to see crazy insane fights like these:\n\n[b][i]Fight 1: Toss my gladiator into the pit with no weapons whilst his opponent is fully geared. Match starts and my gladiator runs around like a headless chicken while getting chased and hacked away, until someone from the crowd tosses him a sword and suddenly he turns into Leonidas and totally chops his opponent's head off in two swings.[/i][/b]\n\n[b][i]Fight 2: Two equipped gladiators start the match, my gladiator immediately disarms his opponent and starts chasing after him like his panties are made of candy.[/i][/b]\n\n[b][i]Fight 3: You just researched evasive rolling, now every fight is like a Dark Souls fight.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]Pros/Cons[/h1]\n\n+Dedicated and passionate dev\n+Spectating gladiator fights\n+Playable gladiator fights\n+(Opinion) The more tasteful side of pixel graphics\n+(Opinion) Nice soundtrack\n+Easy entry management game\n+The nature of the game ensures each new game has a bit of variety from the previous\n+Brutal fights option allows for slightly longer and bloodier matches\n+Flex your cruelty or mercy by allowing your crummy gladiator the chance to live or die\n\n+/- Difficulty/RNG (I PUT this here because theres always a few of you that complain about rng and difficulty. This is personally a PLUS for ME, but for those of you who hate games with even a tiny bit of rng, please just do yourself and everyone else a favor and avoid the game.)\n+/- Game length (Some consider it bad, some consider it good)\n+/- Pixel Graphics (If pixel graphics are a big issue then it should have been obvious that this game wasn't for you, I personally like them)\n\n-Jupiter's Blessing cards aren't terribly interesting, wish there was more variety beyond just numbers (IMO the only card I found interesting was the one that didn't allow your gladiator to heal beyond 50% hp but granted immense killing power, wish there were more cards with interesting give/take conditions like that)\n-Low scenery variety (Same 2-3 looking stadiums)\n-Lack of gladiator name change (At the time of writing this, I'm not allowed to change gladiator names, though the twitch options allow for viewership gladiators, but I don't stream)\n-Spam click for allowing your gladiator to live (Honestly this is the feature of the game I dislike the most, my solution: Allow a coin flip option for those of us who don't care about having more influence over the surrender meter, but make sure you still keep the surrender meter for those who want to spamclick their gladiator to safety)\n\n[h1]TL;DR: This game is for people who like watching gladiators fight, win or lose. This isn't a game to show off your mad skills or to prove something about your inner self, it's about tossing in gladiators and watching them fight to the death and then getting mad at them for losing, then tossing them into the pit naked if you happen to let them survive.[/h1]", "comment_count": 5, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31250666", "weighted_vote_score": "0.889288246631622314", "votes_up": 151, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492793018, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 3}, {"timestamp_created": 1492666498, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027785846", "playtime_forever": 392, "last_played": 1494647066, "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "This game has no business being this fun.\n\nAs they say of dwarf fortress \"lossing is fun\".\nThis game is exciting, stressful, engaging and generally speaking a great time.\n\nAlso just like drawf fortress it doesn't hold your hand, in fact it isn't affraid to leave out key information which can have a significant impact on a run.\n\nIf you like to be challenged, excited and frustrated all at once, this is a game for you.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31250127", "weighted_vote_score": "0.52558135986328125", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492825315, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1492665904, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021695711", "playtime_forever": 292, "last_played": 1492754626, "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Perfect game now with save feature.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31250032", "weighted_vote_score": "0.716965138912200928", "votes_up": 73, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492665904, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 5}, {"timestamp_created": 1492665311, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260723017", "playtime_forever": 2893, "last_played": 1510094426, "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Scratches an itch I've had for a while now. 10/10.

For starters, don't fool yourself with the petty playtime as it is now, I have been experiencing this game from far long before its release, mainly content from playtesters (game owners! refer to the in-game credits, every single one of them had a major role in it!), regardless of how many bugs it had back then. I have seen progression, passion in looking into issues, patches that barely took a day to be mended, and I can assure you, the experience is worth it, especially at a pricetag of $10 or regional equivalent. I even remember the bit of chaos it was to see the stream bot being fine tuned for proper feedback towards either twitch cheering or just !boo ing your favorite streamer out of their in-game reward... it was a nice day.\n\nIt is meant to be a 3-4 hour game, yes. There are flaws, yes. There will always be room for improvement (which it constantly is, without the Early Access baloney), but I can tell you, the experience I've had from it was far more enjoyable and deserves a lot more.\n\nThe soundtrack alone is a selling point, fitting and well done, if you're not convinced, go check out bignic's bandcamp and give it a try (https://bignic.bandcamp.com/album/domina), alternatively, watch a stream and see how it goes, glory even in the face of inevitable failure.\n\nBut I have delayed you long enough. If you like a relatively lightweight (on your PC) gladiator management sim with an outstanding soundtrack. By all means buy it. I highly reccomend it.\n\nBy the way I can assure you that Bignic is constantly looking for feedback, wether it is game or stream bot related.\n\nEDIT 1: I mentioned \"go check out the soundtrack\" as a selling point but my forgetful self forgot to conveniently place the link on the review. Here it is again https://bignic.bandcamp.com/album/domina\n\nEDIT 2: Years later and more content/patches are being added still at no additional price.

Yesterday, I picked this game up hoping for a bit of fun after having known of its existence for about a week or two. I played for about two hours, but I got frustrated, since my main gladiators kept getting killed off later in the game. Today, I decided that I'd go through one full run and then play a different game. I started at about 5:00 and I'm writing this at about 6:30. It turns out that the way that the difficulty of the contender of the next fight is based on the number of victories of your most powerful unit (or something around those lines.) at this point, my most powerful gladiator was dead, so the one that replaced him had 0 wins. I like this system, as it adds an element of forgiveness to an otherwise completely unforgiving game, making it much more enjoyable and much less challenging to keep playing.

I love the concept and gameplay, but there are glaring issues.\n\n\nEarly on when everyone does 10 damage a hit, things are tactical. Every strike matters, and you have to bait and defend properly. Then, a few matches later when your dude is stronger, things become a matter of either getting oneshot or defending(which has very few benefits and risks losing your shield). It stops being tactical and just a numbers comparison of who kills who faster. It's a very sudden shift in gameplay, and all the tactics go out the window. \n\nNext, coming from that, is the issue of levels and your gladiators. Even on easy difficulty, your gladiator who has won many matches may suddenly end up against someone who vastly outdoes him. Repeatedly. Sure, you can decline a match or two, but they don't go back down and eventually you have to either pull a win out of luck/extreme skill or have one of the two dudes pissed at you for not being suicidal. That combined with how snowbally this game is poses a problem. Losing your lead gladiator should be a setback, not a game ending situation. When you lose your lead, the game still acts like he is involved. See the problem? Now you're stuck with less useful gladiators to fight against what are still stronger than his best. Good luck beating the first boss who can oneshot people well above his level.\n\n\nThe two idiots that stay with you have... minimal benefits. You are given choices to befriend the Legate and Magistrate, and it's suggested that by doing so they will make fights easier. Nope. Fights are not easier if you befriend them. They are nigh impossible if you piss the off, but befriending them has the one advantage of one gladiator not costing resources. Kind of nice... I guess.... But you know, it would be nice if instead of getting the 1v5 when they are angry, if I could get a 5v1 when they are pleased. I got that once when I had maxed out both of them, which can be expensive to say the least. I was then promptly forced to piss them off due to multiple rounds of the enemy being many levels higher than my best gladiator. I hope one day I become enough of a genius to figure out how to get my \"friends\" to not make me fight guys way over my level.\n\n\nStats are also horribly explained. Every character has three base stats, which do... something. Aggro, Turtle, and Evasion. Simple, right? But the game doesn't really explain if this is an AI thing(which you can ignore if you control them) or is an actual stat that effects combat. \n\nThe tutorial at least should be good, right? Well... no. It puts you at a disadvantage. Before I got a gladiator wipe fairly deep into the tutorial(which is just the normal game with a few flavor dialogues), I hadn't gotten access to Jupiter Cards, which can make or break the game. \n\n\n\nAll in all, the game can be a lot of fun if absolutely every aspect works with you to give you a perfect run. Otherwise, one mistake or RNG event happening and you lose everything. It's really fun having 2k money and not being able to buy food for a week. Then dying. On a good run. The game can be blatantly unfair, which is not enjoyable. Dark Souls, which is known for \"unfair\", makes a good point of never making it so hard you can't bounce back. This game just flips the table and tells you to screw yourself. I LOVE the concept, gameplay, and pretty much everything, but this game is a balancing nightmare. And with no saves, it punishes people who can't play through 100%. I get it, this is a \"hardcore\" game. But \"hardcore\" does not mean the game should actively screw people over on the EASIEST DIFFICULTY. \n\n\nIf you like the concept, it can be fun. It's also RNG punishment with no real rewards for doing extremely well. Difficulty scaling is horrible, so expect to rage. Admittedly, I am not the most experienced with this game, but my god does it royally screw me over every chance it gets. \n\nI do not recommend this game for the feint of heart. If you are a masochist, go for it. If not... Well yeah.\n\n\n\n\n*The following is written as a later review after changes have been made and difficulty adjusted.* \nThe previous rating for this review was 67% out of 94 votes, with one \"funny\".\nAs of 10/12/17\n\n\nMost of my previous issues have been addressed. The difficulty curve has been adjusted, fights made better, and the two buffoons are more useful. And saves have been added. You can't revert deaths(which is normal for roguelike/roguelite games) however. While I play less due to college and life, the game is gaining polish and shows improvements over time. While the game still can be brutally punishing, it is much more fair and I feel like it is moving down a track for success. I won't say it still doesn't have some rough spots, but this is a fun game. I suggest watching some YouTube videos to see if it's a game you might enjoy, but if it is your style I feel like it is getting better and better.

This game is very simple, realistic, and provides epic battles. These battles can range from one on ones, to epic many vs many with lions and golioths.

There is also an in depth skill, skill tree (I know that's redundant) that lets you unlock new abilitys, and stat upgrades. The anamations are wounderful, and the soundrack is my one of my favorates. The game machanics are simple: block, attack, roll. These three ways of fighting gives the game a Dark Souls fell. \n\nHowever this game doesn't come without it's cons. The game has no save feture at the moment, and it takes around 2hrs to finish the game. This can get frustrating a lot of the time. There is only one \"gamemode\" at the moment that is brutally hard, and gives you no room for mistakes. If your champion gladiator dies in this game to some lucky no name arena scub, you might aswell start over. This is the thing I hate most about this game, it doesn't let you make mistakes.

The developer is communicative and is working hard on refining the game, so I see no reason quality of life features like a savegame and perhaps a more in depth tutorial will be added later on, though as a complete playthrough takes at most a couple of hours (including plenty of pausing to take breaks) the priority at the moment is fixing any game breaking bugs that a few people have encountered.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I have played a total of about 21 hours, and have beaten the game twice, once on normal difficulty and once on hard.

The way it plucks names from your twitch viewers is brilliant as you instantly have an emotional attachment. Then the community voting adds more control.

Again it would be good for returning viewers if the progress was savable, but at this stage it doesn't detract from the fun.  \nThe fight being so quick often means viewers just don't get a chance to cheer or boo, possibly slowing the fight down might help with that.\n\nAnyway if you fancy jumping in and don't mind losing progress for now then get on board, this is a lot of fun for not too much money, if your are a twitch streamer looking for something fun for your stream then its good as it currently is... \n\nThe lack of save is a down point but not enough to put me off the game, it can only get better from here in.\n\nBloody great fun!!!

It took a lot of trial and error, and now that I've done it, I can say that I feel that using Mind Control for the last battle was one of the intense experience I've felt playing a game in a long time. A 10/10 experience for a good final battle + \"epilogue?\". However, over all I must admit that I feel the game was lacking in other areas, and will give it an over-all 6/10. This game can be fun if you enjoy management simulators, though you can also take direct control of your gladiators by using the Mind Control research, which is what can make or break your game sometimes.\n\n*EDIT @ 38 Hours* After 38 hours of game time, I have played the game several times but only beat it probably about 4 times. Since I wrote this review, I have played on and off between a few updates, and even failing to beat the game now, the final battle is still as intense as the first time I played it. This replayability makes this game that much better. Therefore, I feel that the score is probably more along an 8/10 (Rather than a '6' ) with the updates. *EDIT*\n\nWhat I'd like to see in this game:\nA longer game-play time:\nStart to Championship, the game takes about two hours. For some this is too long, but for me this is not long enough. I would like to see an alternate game-mode that will either let me build a group over the course of a few years (in-game), or at least last a little bit longer in terms of real-time, like having multiple matches in a day, each for different fighters. However, this mode would encourage some form of...\n\nA save-state:\nThis game doesn't offer any way to save, with the exception that the game will attempt to load a crashed game. Saving a crashed game is an awesome thing to add to the game, as I have personally felt the affects of completely losing a 1 1/2 hour game because of a fatal error. \nThat said, I would like to be able to stop the game and come back to it later, if only to place the game into a pause until I've got the time to resume my Domina experience.\n\n*EDIT @ 38 hours* The game now has a save-state which dramatically improved playability for me, especially because of the crashes that can sometimes occur during play. This makes it so that I can exit the game and re-join the same game after the last battle, which will reduce the lag upon re-entering the game.  *EDIT*\n\nMore subltety, sneaky tricks, and/or consequences:\nThere's a few moments in the game that feel repeated a few times, such as an opponent who starts out wounded or goes 3v1. One said enemy one-hit killed one of my gladiators for over 500 points of damage. That's great. Loss is a part of the game, and I can handle that. That being said, I never take those fights now because I know that doing them will be instant death for at least one of my fighters. There's no consequence for me saying no (save for the small amount of wine I pay for rejecting), and little incentive for me to say yes. I feel that there should either be A) more moments like this, B) make them less obvious, and C) add more consequences (and potentially more rewards for taking on these *actual* champions that can one-shot some of the giants that exist on the map). \n\nWider variance in situations\nThere's a labrynth in the bottom of the colosseum in Rome, so why couldn't there be one in Domina? I think it would shake things up if there was a randomly generated maze that had free-roaming lions in it along with an opponent. Who can last the longest or kill the other first? (Mind Control recommended)\nFree-for-alls. Is your gladiator the best of the four of them?\n\nPerhaps more obstacles, potentially obstacles that damage, such as fire pits, or people on the sides that spear you if you get too close to the edge.\n\nBetter tool-tips:\nThis game doesn't really spell out a whole lot of the nuances of stats. After looking at several reviews and discussions, it seems that a lot of people have no idea what does what. For instance, until I googled it, I didn't know that you had to alternate your mouse clicks in order to save a downed gladiator. Perhaps adding a mouse icon with alternating highlights would help there.\n\nNow, it's easy to point out things that I think would be cool to add, but it can be very difficult to add some of these things in practice. I see a lot of room for improvement for the game, but I still recommend it because I had fun developing a group of gladiators, reading the commentary and various social situations, and having Dark Souls-esque final boss fights with a giant, wearing nothing but a a shield and Gladius because I accidently set my mind control to a naked Murmillo.\n\n*EDIT @38 Hours* I would like to thank the game creator for continuing to truck through the updates despite negative reviews and complaints about games modes, lag, and saving the game. This is a solid game and I'm glad to see it's improvement. *EDIT*", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31091110", "weighted_vote_score": "0.538429975509643555", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1494607382, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491971485, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005402679", "playtime_forever": 610, "last_played": 1492239549, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Do not waste your time or effort or money or attention.

The game has some serious potential with tons of room for improvements and add ons, do bear in mind that the dev team is just one very dedicated guy, so to see all this being produced by one individual is nothing short of amazing.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n-Soundtracks are incredible, really fitting for the theme and invokes a sense of bloodlust.\n-Awesome pixel art style graphics, very pleasing to the eyes to witness pixel art dismemberments. \n-Combat is really fun and fast paced.\n-Not only can you spectate but you can get your hands dirty and control a single gladiator and wreak havoc in the arena.\n-Lions... just LIONS... (Arena obstacles are a wonderful addtition to make the matches more interesting and fun.)\n-Twitch intergration is a unique and so far well received feature. Fate of your gladiators rest on their (chat) hands not yours.\n-Great variety of upgradable weapons, armour, and gear.\n-Test your best gladiators against the Boss Champions all across Rome to see if you have what it takes as a Domina and if your gladiators have what it takes to be a true Champion.\n-Despite being a very simple gladiator management simulation the game has great depth and has alot to offer.\n-The game is incredibly cheap and worth every penny and you get hours upon hours of fun, entertainment, and enjoyment. \n-The game is fresh with great humour and ridiculous random events to could either make or ruin your day.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-The games overall dificulty and A.I require some serious tweaking and rebalancing.\n\n-Pit fights are no longer ideal fight options due to the enemy scaling to your strongest gladiator leaving scrubs unable to level up and most times even wrecking your Champion despite a great differential in terms of stats and also the ridiculously poor rewards do not reflect the dificulty of the enemies, most times being only either 120 to 200 gold. No matter how many enemies you have to face the gold/reward does not scale accordingly with the danger and risk of the match.\n\n-REWARDS as a whole at the moment are seriously underwhelming and lacking even if you win 80% of all match ups and suffer no losses and casualties.\nMax rewards i have seen so far was 650 gold plus 400 gold from crowd favour, this was from a 10v10 (which i lost ofcourse) against nothing but godlike Retiarus that made quick work of my own elites.\nThe max rewards for every arena fight averages and caps at 500 gold with max favour, which is not enough.\nYou have 15 gladiators you have to train and fully equip by the end of the year, at 2000 gold each gladiator thats 30000 gold. Thats if you suffer no casualties not to mention other upgrades you have to spend gold on, you'd have to win 60 matches with max favour without suffering casualties and the game only has a match once every 15 days out of the time limit of 365 days.\n\nThats 24 matches only, minus pitfights.\n\nDont get me started on Champion fights, the rewards you get after risking your 3 best gladiators that took 100 days to train and and thousands of gold to equip would just die to a super buff op Boss Champion with ridiculous hp and dmg.\n\nIf you do defeat the Boss champion, you are rewarded with 250 gold. (Pls fix this)\nBoss fights should be lucrative and enticing and worth risking your best gladiators, also the Boss fights are a requirement in order to participate the Emperors Championship so the hands of the players are tied. \n\n-You are given single game mode that has 365 days for you to make it into the Emperors Tournament or you die either way.\n\nPerhaps this can be built upon and instead of just having a single year to participate maybe there can be a 5 or even 10 year campaign. Or hell maybe you can continually pass the Ludus down to your descendants and you play as them trying to build the ultimate and most famed gladitorial house in all of Roma.\n\n-Game limit is 365 days, days go by way too fast. Especially is you have 15 gladiators to manage. This makes things unnecessarily hectic,perhaps adjusments could be fixed into the settings to choose the duration for each day.\n\nslow= 1 day/ 24 seconds\nmoderate= 1 day/ 12 seconds\nfast= 1 day/ 6 seconds\n\n-Architect options take too long to build to fully utilize benefits, each project takes an average of 30 days to be fully built especially since only 365 days are given. Also minor add ons such as gathering stones and digging hot coal pits should be reduced from 3 days to 1, to fully equip your ludus 15 palus/stones/coals = 135 days not to mention other lengthy 30 day projects.\n\n(This is only an issue due to the short time frame the player is given, either reducing the build time or increasin the players game time.)\n\n-Gladiator training could be hastened, very rare to actually have a gladiator achieve level 40 on all stats let alone 15 of them.\n\n-Slave varity is lacking, each slave excels in different attributes but most slaves only come with either minimum 120hp to max 174hp, occasionally there should be a rare slave that would come to the players way with extraodinary stats.\n\n-Gladiator hp is incredibly lack luster, each slave should start off at 150 to 200 hp but should be able to attain 300+ hp after months of training. Max possible achieved is 200+ training since day 1. Especially since boss champions have half a thousand hitpoints.\n\n-Arena has same issue with pitfight, arena enemy scales with your strongest gladiator and doesnt produce match up for new recruits leaving the srubs permenantly underleveled or butchered if you take the chance.\n\n-Every tournament which is every 15 days there is only a single fight to be had by 1 of your guys vs the enemy ai. So this means that every 15 days only 1 of your guys gets to fight. The other 14 just continue training hoping for a fair match up that will never come.\nThere should be a multi tier/rank fight every 15 days so that all of your gladiators get a fair chance at leveling and progressing forward.\n\na)Low tier/rank is where your scrubs will fight giving them a fair chance at leveling.\nb)Mid tier/rank for your mid tier gladiators.\nc)High tier/rank for your champion to face off against other other high tier champions. \n\nAlso each tier should yield its own rewards system, for example you have lost the mid tier fight but your men prevailed on the low and high tier. The player should receive rewards from each tier accordingly.\n\nWinning low tier/rank yields 250 gold\nwinning mid tier/rank yields 500 gold\nwinning high tier/rank yields 1000 gold\n\nThe total pay off if the player wins all Tier/rank fights would be 1750 gold, a much more realistic and dependable system that could sustain the player through out the game,\n\nThe player can also choose which tier/rank to participate in either all, none, or some.\n\nSame system could be employed for pitfights.\n\n(This could effectively fix the entire lack luster rewards system by implementing this.)\n\n-Group fights are very rare and hardly fair, going up against 10 Retiarus with high tier equipment and godly stats that can 2 shot your gladiators. (You may as well quit and start over)\n\n-Cards are now too rare, can barely get 8 through out a single play through.\n\n-Game doesnt have any gambling mechanic, you should be able to bet on your own gladiators to increase the payout,winnings are determined based on the odds that are stacked against or for your own gladiators.\n\n-Pitfights should have fist only brawls, a good place to make use of the scrubs. They can still make the player money and use only their bare fists while fighting naked.\n\n-And last but not least, the lack of a save system. This will no longer be a valid concern bacause by the time you are done reading this it may have already been implemented, if not it will be soon.\n\n-Pro gamer mode is impossible at the curent state of the game.\n\nThank you for reading and i hope you enjoy the game as much as i have, it is truly worth it at the end of the day.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31034169", "weighted_vote_score": "0.818258941173553467", "votes_up": 61, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491811727, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491717428, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025124612", "playtime_forever": 2428, "last_played": 1536049681, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "i wandering why 356 day only...is that value for this game ??\ngave me back my money.\nNo Save option!!\nLimitles !!\n", "comment_count": 2, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "31033147", "weighted_vote_score": "0.34275442361831665", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491717428, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"timestamp_created": 1491711475, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051000497", "playtime_forever": 616, "last_played": 1522850657, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "good game", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31032009", "weighted_vote_score": "0.432844430208206177", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491711475, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491705045, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109877308", "playtime_forever": 594, "last_played": 1527622408, "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "The game has a save now. Ignore the negative reviews that say it doesn't, they are not up to date yet.\n\nThere are some pros and cons to the game, which is why the reviews are so mixed for this. Unlike other games which are a good solid part in some parts and lacking in others, Domina seems to excel in some respects and fall way behind in others. More specifically, fall behind in a major way with just one thing. This is why the community is so split, because Domina works so well for some and so badly for others.\n\nKeep in mind this game is in it's infancy, and the developer is working very hard and releasing a lot of updates to combat and fix the game. Still, the game requires work and is not 100% developed.\n\nLet's get this out of the way:\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n[b]Bugs.[/b] There are many glitches in the game people complain about, mostly about crashing near the end of the campaign and just crashing in general.\n\nThe lack of an endless mode is another problem. Or rather the game only really has one way to play it, and [b]it only takes an hour or two to beat.[/b] Mix that with the incredible difficulty ramp and you have a recipe for an even shorter game.\n\nAlso the lack of an endless mode is kinda a problem in-of-itself.\n\nFinally, [b]Balancing issues[/b]. Fights can seem a bit quick, although later I'll explain how that can be seen as a good thing too. Regardless AI seem to be a bit simplistic and suicidal, and sometimes fights can seem rather one sided against you. At first it'll be easy if a bit challenging and then suddenly the AI will seem to crank up the difficulty to death metal.\n\nSo the game is pretty hard. Like, take Enter the Gungeon difficulty and double it kind of hard. Like Dark Souls except you get sent back to the beggening every time kind of hard. Some wierdos like me will enjoy it, normal people will play it much to their chagrin. Or, you know, you could read a manual.\n\nAlright, time for the...\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\nThe biggest pro, in my opinion, is the game's [b]soundtrack.[/b] The game's soundtrack was created by the developer himself, which is why it seems to fit almost perfectly into the game. The way the music weaves in and out of arena fights and moments of calm is rather well set up. If you like the 8-bit, retro-y electronic tracks of Hotline Miami and Deadbolt, you'll like Domina's soundtrack.\n\nThe arena fights can be a little too fast paced in my taste, but they are a nice comfortable combo of [b]brutal and random.[/b] Weapons do enough damage that they actually feel like they're weapons and not kitchen utencils, armor makes a significant change to the performance of a gladiator, for better or worse, and yet somehow the game retains a comfy level of random elements so that even someone who is outgunned in every way still might just win.

Everything feels really quick and easy. \n+Fun Unit Management\nYour gladiators have stats that determine what kind of play style they use during fights (Aggro, Turtle, Evasive) and determining what kind of stats and what class you\u2019ll choose based on their play style. Your gladiators train those stats in between matches. After a few matches; you start to learn about hiring NPCs (some help train your gladiators; others help in different ways) and playing cards (equipped to gladiator for bonuses; including combat bonuses, training stat bonuses, etc.) so there are a bunch of ways that you can acquire upgrades for your warriors. (PS: Something that is never mentioned by the game is that getting a gladiator\u2019s MEDITATE stat to 100 is really important; you probably should upgrade that as soon as you get warrior. [It upgrades faster than other stats]) You can get 15 gladiators are try to manage exactly how you want them to become. \n+Great Art Style \nThe aesthetic of this game is absolutely perfect with the whole theme of the game. It\u2019s sort of a retro 32-bit style. animations are fluid. Colours are sort of warm; yet drab and mildly depressing. The story isn\u2019t deep, but really gives you some bearings. \n+Soundtrack\nI don\u2019t know enough about music to go in depth on how the music is good, but it really helped set the mood in the game. Good stuff. \n\n-Cons: \n+No Save \nThe fact that the game has no way to save your progress is literally flooding the Steam reviews. I do agree that it would add to the game; however I can definitely see where the developer was coming from. After getting a grasp of the game\u2019s main mechanics; it should only take a few hours to complete a full run. He intended to make this a game where you play a full run in one sitting; also, saving would allow people to exploit the system by saving before a fight and retrieving a fighter that you really like.\nI personally don\u2019t see anything wrong with exploiting a single player game (although I personally wouldn\u2019t play like that) and saving would allow you to keep your progress if you suddenly need to take care of something; which would be nice. \n+Doesn\u2019t disclose everything\nI\u2019m very much into games that don\u2019t hold your hand, however I feel like having some resources online knowing exactly how each stat changes your gladiator\u2019s play would be ideal. For example, I notice that some of my gladiators have really high attack speed; others don\u2019t. If you look in the stats, none of them mention attack speed. So, how do I increase it? No idea. I assume eventually this is something that will become available through a fan wiki. \nAlso, [MILD SPOILER BUT I DON\u2019T SPOIL PLOT ELEMENTS] another thing that isn\u2019t disclosed has to do with the ending. You basically can\u2019t win the game without finishing the game once; because there is something disclosed in a failed ending that allows you to actually beat the game. This was frustrating on upon completing my first playthrough and just seems like a way to get you to play more than once rather than actually entertaining the player.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "31002609", "weighted_vote_score": "0.637363910675048828", "votes_up": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491591199, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491589592, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369785936", "playtime_forever": 157, "last_played": 1492301850, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Fun game... not sure what else to say... it's like Spartacus management.

SUMMARY OF NEEDED CHANGES AT THE BOTTOM\n\nI'm probably saying what a lot people are saying but let me go at it.\n\n\n\nThe game is hard, like, unfair hard. \n\nEvery time you try to level up your scrubs into gladiatorial gods they just eventually die in one hit out of now where, which i can undestand the game is just trying to simulate the unpredicatability of a actual gladiatorial fight, but the game has a hideously noticeable unfair advantage over you the player.\n\nThe Ai opponents will always have elite gladiators that will reduce your boys to garabage in a instant.  As a result you are constantly forced to put all your cards into one single elite gladiator in your ludus, which makes things extreamly risky as you could lose everything in a single bout, elminating all your progess in a game. I understand risks are a big part in the game, but it shouldn't be so excessive that you become unable to make any progress. \n\nSince its almost impossible to make any progression for any of your gladiator(s), you're pretty much just going to lose by the end of the year. \n\n\nSpeaking of which, I know a lot of people don't like the 1 year timeline you have in this game, but I just view it as a legitable and fair challenge to the game, you know, the whole objective of the game is to have a whole cohort of elite gladitors who will win the finnal tournament so you can win the grand prize and restore your families honor. Being able to do that in one year is challenging and exciting, at least in theory, since the Ai has a unfair advantage to you in all scenarios it makes acomplishing that goal almost impossible. \n\nBut still if you don't like the 1 year time frame, then it wouldn't be a bad idea to implement a sandbox mode for the game so that anyone can go at a relaxed pace when playing with their gladiators. \n\n\nAlso the issue with the save is a big deal. At first i didn't mind there not being a save, because its forcing you to make quick decisions for the whole year. But realistically, the no save feature should be for a like an achivement mode or something, becasue practically i can't sit down and lose two to three hours of my life just to fail horribly towards the end of the year.\n\nIts just impratical for any game these days to not have a save feature.\nHell this game would be fine with at least a auto save, kinda like iron man mode in Crusader Kings 2 or EUIV, a feature that you can pick up any time you want so you don't have to sit by the computer all day to finish the game. \n\n\nBut to be fair, I must admit I do enjoy the soundtrack to this game, that's something thats going good for this game at least. \n\nAlso they're not many gladiator simulaiton games out there, this game is already making a good attempt at it. \n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nMake the AI opponents in this game balanced, let there be actual opportunity for all of your gladiators, not just one, to level up and be formidable fighters. \n\nStop dumping Elite gladiators at every single match against your low level scrubs, its always just a opportunity to watch your scrubs die instantly\n\nImplement a sandbox mode so that anyone can take a more relaxed pace at this game and enjoy everything that this game has to offer. \n\nImplement a freaking save system, or at least a auto save system so I don't have to sit through a 2-3 hour playthrough every time I turn on this game. \n\n\n\n\nFor what its worth, this is still a intersting game, and I do enjoy the soundtrack, if the developers would make a few improvements on this product, then we might have ourselves a pretty unique one of a kind video game that should be shared with everyone. \n\nSUMMARY SUMMARY,\n\n\nDear developers, make a few improvements to this game that are being requested by all of your consumers, then this game could be really really fun and I would recomend it to anyone. \n\n\nPlease fix game, so It can be super cool.\n\n\n\nUntil then, I'll still leave a thumbs up on this game simply because of the soundtrack, and with the hopes that the game might be drastically improved with a few updates.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30991242", "weighted_vote_score": "0.462046205997467041", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491683227, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491541222, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044901391", "playtime_forever": 789, "last_played": 1513710832, "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Damn this game is dark and pretty fucked up.

Not technically a glitch but it felt scummy, would like to be able to beat the game with AI control only, as I am more interested in the management than the fighting.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI suppose my main complaint of this game  would be that there seems to be no real correlation between the game's unique gladiator stats and what you see unfold on the battlefield. I have played many playthroughs, probably over 7 complete playthroughs. It is still not obvious to me what each stat is responsible for. Overwhelmingly what I see is that no matter the opponents stats, the enemy AI will attack first and faster as well as dodge and block more more effectively. I have had gladiators who weigh less, have higher aggro, higher AI skill, and higher agility than the opponent who do not even get a single hit on them, because they are repeatedly struck with attacks that are commited with higher frequency AND swung more quickly than they are able to perform. The only reason I can come to for this is that the AI has already researched everything the Doctore offers. If this is the case, you are at such an extreme disadvantage from the beginning that you will lose 60+% of all battles you engage in where you allow the AI to control the friendly gladiator. This enemy AI 'cheat' is not only frustrating, but creates an environment where it is impossible to determine how to improve your situation, because even with a better equipped gladiator with higher stats in every category will be repeatedly beaten by a slave scrub with a dagger. To me, it seems this game is 95% RNG, but RNG that is stacked in favor of the enemy AI. I have had massive success in this game when controlling the gladiators myself, but to me, this feels like cheating and I do not think I should have to take direct control to win battles. Until more information is released about the way the friendly AI operates, I will continue to be frustrated by what appears to be an immensely stacked deck in favor of the opposing AI.\n\nTo sum it up, this is why I give a negative review:\n\n1. Unclear what stats are responsible for\n2. Unclear as to why enemy AI seems to be much more efficient than allied AI\n3. No save function\n4. End success requires you to sacrifice your best gladiators, which basically resets your progress\n5. enemy progression functionality seems to be (loosely) based on the best gladiator in your camp, therefore you basically require your best gladiator to fight every single battle, which makes them better and better, which makes the enemy harder and harder.\n\nMy suggestions:\n\n1. Find a way to vary enemy gladiator difficulty\n2. Release more information on gladiator stats\n3. Add more \"random\" chance in what the enemy gladiator will be, I am tired of fighting elite gladiators in the pit, to me, the pit should be for scrubs so you can train up your scrubs. By basing ALL enemy difficulty on the best gladiator, you make it nearly impossible to train up the other gladiators in the camp through combat.\n5. Allow either all gladiator classes to be available at the start, or allow the player to choose which to start with, the spear class has an obvious advantage over all other classes, and I find the friendly ai for the Thraex to be pathetic compared to the ai for the other two.", "comment_count": 16, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "30990434", "weighted_vote_score": "0.883380651473999023", "votes_up": 228, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1493606298, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 2}, {"timestamp_created": 1491534805, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052029516", "playtime_forever": 192, "last_played": 1492693313, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "THUMBS DOWN TO UP!", "comment_count": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30990246", "weighted_vote_score": "0.491904199123382568", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1493102004, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491533192, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972659536", "playtime_forever": 3365, "last_played": 1493410077, "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "i would wait and see if this gets better dont buy how it is as of apr 06", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "30989975", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499045103788375854", "votes_up": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491533192, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491525124, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271781253", "playtime_forever": 1053, "last_played": 1550105128, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "This game is actually really fun, like REALLY fun... there arent any other games like it and it does it pretty well, still needs a little balancing but I cant wait to see where this game goes", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30988676", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491525124, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491519247, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989281707", "playtime_forever": 1529, "last_played": 1542525973, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Really enjoying this game!

While your training him, research the attack roll and get a hold of the Jupiters blessing card called: balance.\n5. Kite out your guy as much as possible - the closer to 100 damage the better.\n6. Take him into a god ol pit fight and mind control him. \n7. ROLL! Throw your net or just roll straight into him.\n8. Balance means he gets 500% crit damage, which means you'll deal 500+ damage if you already do 100+.\n9. Continue until he got the best gear and training.

If you want to leave the game, you have to do it the old-school style and leave it on a screen were the time is stopped. According to the devs, this is an intended feature but I can't help thinking that it's a step back. F.ex. FTL also has a \"one game at'a time\" set-up, but at least the let you save the game in between sessions. They say that this game is made to be started, and finished, in one sitting but a lot of people simply do not have the time for that.\n\nI am a huge fan of games in the pixel art-style, and Domina certainly looks the part; the animations looks great and has a lot of punch to it. Clearly a lot of thought has been put into it, and more than once I have found my self laughing more than I should of something unexpected happening, like a member of the audience accidentally getting cut down and exploding all over the benches.\n\nThe music is also fantastic and really gets you in the mood, though might get a bit boring after a bit since there are not many different bits available.\n\nHowever: there is a huge problem of depth. Or, to be more precise - the lack thereof.\n\nA LOT of info is lacking, and you need to start, and restart, the game countless times before you start to figure out some of the basics that are hidden (and smells of oversight rather than obfuscation). \nThings like Attack Rate are not explained, nor even hinted at, in the tool tips which I find really weird because in the Pre-Release version it is stated in under the Weapon Skill? \nThe tutorial is a joke - it explains nothing of how the actual game works and are played, but works more like a set-up for the backstory.\n\nBalance is also a huge issue - there are some Employees that are objectivly better than all the others, so every run-through you buy the same ones over and over again, simply because it's no point to hire the other ones. \nThe gear you can outfit your gladiators with are also horribly presented: they give you the weight and defense-numbers, but when you buy it there is logical system behind it; it's all clumped up in a long line of upgrades and degrades, making it nearly impossible to optimize your gladiators. \nI really wished they put some more gear in aswell - the gladiators have a lot of Hard Points for gear, but very little possibility for individuality.\n\nLastly, the AI and how the gear works is a complete mystery - there a plenty of times your 6-800 worth of solider gets cut up to ribbons by an AI opponent that hits a thousand times a minute and your guy gets knocked around like there is no tomorrow even if the opponent has next to no good gear. Some of this can be remedied by controlling your gladiator yourself, but some times there is nothing you can do. \nCombine this with a LOT of weird behavior, and I think it's safe to say that the entire combat AI needs some work and balancing. \n\nSo is it a good game? Yes it is. Does it need a lot of work and polish and have the distinct taste and smell of being undercooked? Yes it does.

No one wants to see their hard work walk away.\n-Right now if you choose to control your character AI will best you late game. AI is just better and faster.\n-Make pit fights managable, they scale too fast atm.\n-Overall late game fights I've noticed don't really rely on stats, which is weird- they should matter more.

On the day it released I spent 5.8hrs straight on the game. It is quite difficult but thats fine for me... but there is options to make it more difficult or less difficult. Now with just over 12hrs spent on the game it has become quite easy as i've learned what to do.\n\nThe people you can hire also varies from a person that makes it so that you can do automatic upgrades and automatic weapon and armor repair to a person that can pray to select [b] Roman Gods [/b] to give your gladiators buffs. The weapons and armor also vary but I found that I could upgrade two of my guys to max gear in just 90 (ingame) days. \n\nWhat I also like about this game is the skills you can unlock. Theres quite a few of them and depending on what path you go you can unlock two new types of gladiators. Speaking of the gladiator classes, 3 of them to be precise, I found that they have their own drawbacks and strengths but farely balanced.\n\nThe music for this game is really unique and nice to listen to but I think the price of the soundtrack is a little overpriced, granted you don't have to buy it. Also kudos to the dev for making the soundtrack to the game by himself!\n\nThis game doesn't have a save feature though, it isn't a problem for me, but I understand that most people have lives, unlike me, and don't have time to sit 2hrs straight and complete a game. There is a kind of a save feature, if your game crashes it makes a backup save and you can go back into the game and continue. There is also a way around that. If you open up your tast manager, for those who don't know you press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and when the screen pops up click on \"Start Task Manager\", you can end the process through there and it will make a save of the previous day.

There are some bugs but the dev is working quickly to fix them. I've only run into a few but nothing game breaking at all for me atleast. I do wish there was a endless mode, so I could just see how long I could really keep my Luda going before I make a horrible mistep. There is plenty of different variations on how you want to run your Luda and train your men. To hiring a good number of different employees, keeping certain characters happy or unhappy. To even controlling one of your own men. You really can mix and match and see what works for you in this game. \n\nAll in all for this game, i'd rate is a 8/10.

Many of my other criticisms still stand, but for 10 bucks, it's now worth the money in my opinion. ***\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game has a lot of potential. A gladiator ludus management sim, with the choice of manual or automatic control of fighters in pits? Sign me up.\n\nUnfortunately right now the sim falls quite a bit short of expectations. The lack of a save/continue function makes the game only playable in a single sitting, and as a playthrough can take several hours, that put its out of reach of many. The game is also limited to a single year (with days passing pretty quickly), so there is no 'career' mode. It's a single linear campaign with no open-ended play.\n\nBut the biggest bugbear for me is (still) the incredibly fast time-to-kill in the medium-to-late stages of the game. Domina has an interesting skill/tech tree, but pretty much *all* of it will become inconsequential as you level to the point where each match will last but a few seconds. What's that I hear people say? The dev added a feature to cut weapon damage and slow down matches? Yes. I'm talking about WITH this feature selected - by the end an average match will still last <10 seconds. The problem seems to be (at least partially) with a small number of ridiculously overpowered traits (available to both players and NPCs) that will essentially one-shot-kill targets. This also makes the late-game Retiarius class *utterly* pointless.\n\nSo right now I'd avoid picking this up, at least until save games, balance issues, career mode etc are patched in. Keep it on your watchlist. The dev seems responsive at least.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30967101", "weighted_vote_score": "0.503045320510864258", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492753271, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491418354, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998074467", "playtime_forever": 502, "last_played": 1491416942, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "As a Twitch Broadcaster this is a fun game to play for a day or two, especially if partnered with access to cheers/bits.  It's potentially the best idea so far in terms of integration with bits as it allows people to affect the game via cheers.  \n\nHowever, after playing through the game a single time I can say that there are a few things that are critically flawed about this game.  The game is based around two parts, the strategic and the combat arena. It's important to note this is a week 1 review, and the developer (a single individual) has released the game where a lot of these issues may be resolved in future patches.  It's also important to note that there are already a significant amount of patches in the time of it's release, which shows well for the developer. \n\nGood points:\n- Those who seek strategy can feel accomplished when they find a solid strategy\n- The combat is fun to watch\n- VERY enjoyable for Twitch broadcasters/communities, especially partnered broadcasters with access to cheers\n- Enjoyable soundtrack that doesn't get old.\n\n\nA few main points that may be resolved in future patches\n- The game doesn't have a save feature (Highly requested and should be added soon)\n- Combat is just right and too fast, depending on your playstyle.  (Implementing a game speed option would resolve)\n- As you can only choose 3 workers at a time out of a variety, they are not balanced and 3-4 are significantly better)\n- Tutorial incorporates story moreso than learning, done in a fashion that puts you at a disadvantage as you don't have all options unlocked on day one. \n- First impression shows that replayability is based on trial and error more than exploration (Balance patches should resolve)\n- RNG plays a factor but proper strategy can alleviate the issues.  \n- Lack of variety of arenas.  Only 1 main arena, 1 pit area, 1 boss area. \n- Strategy time period not having a pause or time adjustment period means that the entire game feels very rushed.  \n- Late game doesn't seem to evolve, it simply becomes repeated task simulator. \n\n\nCritical issues that will take more of an issue\n- Combat AI is very \"move forward and attack\" and is a cornerstone of the system.  This becomes a very disappointing situation when you incorporate more than 1 on 1 gameplay.  You have situations were 8 people rush to the middle, attack simultaneously, one spray of blood and it feels RNG that the combatants you setup for hours are now gone in a moment.  The only way I can see this handled is AI improvements where they do more than \"rush and attack\".\n- The research tree is interesting but it may require a remake to solve a personal concern I have for this game. It felt like they found as many metrics as they could adjust for the gladiators and put it all together in a form of \"This is evolved form of that\" for each of the branches.  The game starts with 1 unlocked class, but requires you to go 1/3rd of the game in opposite directions to unlock another class. While this was enjoyable the first time, it would potentially benefit the game to have the classes unlockable near the beginning, and the trees expanding from them involve traits that follow that classes specifics.  Doing this for all three classes would mean you could focus on their strengths. \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: \n\n**In terms of a first playthrough as a Twitch broadcaster, I personally feel it was a good experience.** But the release is for all individuals, not just Twitch broadcasters.  And it feels like it was released without consideration of simple features, such as a save system.  \n\nFor an average person looking for strategy/combat game, I can't recommend this game unfortunately to the masses outside of that exception.  If many of the issues get patched in the future and the developer replies to this (At time that those patches are implemented) I may adjust this to be recommended, just not in it's week 1 state.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "30966649", "weighted_vote_score": "0.563294172286987305", "votes_up": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491418354, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491418147, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985118166", "playtime_forever": 486, "last_played": 1543747253, "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "+ Great gameplay\n+ Superb art style\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n- Very punishing (you can lose your best gladiator in a single fight for good)\n\nAdd a save feature and the reviews will skyrocket.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30966607", "weighted_vote_score": "0.499876499176025391", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492699659, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491409431, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960438659", "playtime_forever": 1352, "last_played": 1547676736, "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Although the game lacks certain features for which the single dev. is intent on adding; this is a great game at a great price point.\n\nI love the hardcore nature of the game as it currently is; and with the addition of a save feature (hopefully auto-save only to maintain its hardcore nature) it will be well on its way to one of the better games I've played in 2017. \n\nIf you're not a hardcore player, or don't have the stomach for it then this game is not for you.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30964075", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1494129673, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491408919, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147611445", "playtime_forever": 2709, "last_played": 1543632749, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "I really enjoy training up my men to just watch them fight.

Sometimes i felt like i was playing the SIMS, but not the SIMS now, the SIMS when you didn't care about the fact you were playing a game of someone living, you thought it was fun, then you realised it was boring, this is that same feeling except with Gladiators, and kiling, the way games should be.

The developer clearly did some research when making this. Its got lots of Roman culture and history pulled together into a game that feels like a mashup between an HBO drama and a Monty Python film. However, my bigest complaint is that the controls and the interractions between various elements are not at all clear many of the times. For instance, one of the classes has a net on it, and I still dont know after beating the game thrice how to throw a net. Similarly the combat mechanics seem to break down as the number of combatants increases, for this reason the very very late game is somewhat messy and unintelligible. Don't get me wrong, there is good occlusion like we see in FTL event dialogs, and this game captures some of that, but it also has quite a bit of poorly done occlusion where you're not quite certain for example whether the favour of the legit and magistrate actually effect the matches. All told, I think this game is worth the $10 for the fun you'll have pretending to be a roman gladiator/ludas owner, and trying to figure out how to beat the game.

Diving in, we\u2019re greeted with of a simple tutorial that doesn\u2019t do all that well of a job explaining how things work. It took some fiddling before I figured out some of the more \u201cin depth\u201d features.\n\nThe whole premise of this game is that you\u2019re put into the role of training gladiators. And that\u2019s \u2013 really it hahah. The point is to train your fighters to compete in the arena. You accomplish this in a somewhat boring fission, right clicking. There is a way to manage what stat a gladiator prioritizes training \u2013 but that\u2019s about the extent of control you have. This game has a heavy emphasis on simulation with very little actual gameplay. \n\nThere are three classic gladiator classes to pick from when training a new recruit. Murmilla, Thraex, and Retiarius. Yes, I know I butchered the pronunciations. These three would have been considered the primary classes in ye olden days, however, there were many-many other classes of gladiator available \u2013 and it\u2019s kind of a shame they didn\u2019t bother adding any more.\n\nAlong with training you can upgrade your gladiators gear by again, right clicking. There is a big selection of gear upgrades  - and achieving the best possible equipment is difficult. Losing a match and living will often downgrade your gear which can be a little annoying as you tend to run into the issue of not having enough gold to repurchase your losses. This means that if you\u2019re not well established with more than one good fighter then it could spell game over.\n\nAh \u2013 game over\u2026 There\u2019s absolutely no way to save. That\u2019s\u2026 an interesting choice of direction. I quit the game to go eat a some lunch and came back trying to figure out how to load an autosave - and was quickly smacked in the face with the conclusion that there were no saves. I just don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind this, and quite frankly think this is the game\u2019s biggest downfall. I haven\u2019t looked at any other reviews yet as I want to do this unbiased \u2013 but I feel like this is going to be the biggest gripe people will have. \n\nThe actual gladiator battles ARE entertaining. The violent dance that is presented is an awesome spectacle to behold. At first you will be forced into only watching as your gladiator that you just spent the last 10 minutes training helps impale himself on the enemy\u2019s spear. This can be a little frustrating and disheartening \u2013 but at least it looks good, right? Eventually, you\u2019ll unlock the upgrade that allows you to control your fighters first hand.\n\nThis is where I think the game really starts to kick in and the fun level starts to show. I did get quite a bit of enjoyment going in and fighting. It wasn\u2019t easy winning some battles \u2013- well at least when you die you don\u2019t feel the aggravation of the poor AI claiming your hard placed clicks.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s talk about what this game is really about \u2013 the music. Omergerd, the music is so good in this game. I wasn\u2019t joking in my intro when I said this game is just one big advertisement. They throw the option to purchase the soundtrack in your face every chance they get. And I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t buy it after this review \u2013 with my refund money hahah. \n\nIn conclusion, I have to say this game was interesting. I did enjoy myself taking part in the fights, however, at the current $10 they\u2019re asking I must question their logic. I\u2019ll repeat myself, this feels absolutely like a $3 mobile game - at best. I honestly don\u2019t see myself getting more than a couple hours and that makes me sad inside. Not only at the amount of money I spent, but at the hopes that it could have been something much more.\n\n\ntl;dr add a save function.", "comment_count": 1, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": false, "recommendationid": "30948156", "weighted_vote_score": "0.525677978992462158", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491332646, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491330333, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960522307", "playtime_forever": 4873, "last_played": 1551265713, "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Glorious top down pixelarted gladiator combat with gladiator school management to boot.\n\nThe game has alot of potential and hopefully the dev will keep on improving this game!", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30947528", "weighted_vote_score": 0, "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1492813011, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491328796, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975854441", "playtime_forever": 372, "last_played": 1522099842, "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Enjoying my time with the game so far but the no save feature got me :/ Was a few hours in and not too far from the end but it was 2am and went to bed....", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30947074", "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "votes_up": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491328796, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491328728, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039154309", "playtime_forever": 169, "last_played": 1491236592, "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Shocked by the abrubt end to this game.

It scratches that gladiator itch that I have had, and I assume many others have. Being able to control the gladiators yourself is cool. I like the tech tree, though I would prefer more types of gladiators classes and for them to be further down on the tech tree to get earlier. As it is, it takes more than half the game to get either of the two extras, which puts you in control of the base class for the most part. This is not a big deal, and not even a con, just not a pro either I would say.\n\n The controls are pretty straight forward, and from what I saw, they can be changed to suit the player. The game is twitch chat enabled, so your gladiators can be named after streamers followers/subs if they choose. Having this integration is pretty cool, and honestly, considering how easy it is, more games need to get on that hype train.\n\nOk so now to the crux of the situation with this game. This game is cheap at $10 really. The game is fun, and I sat and had a ton of fun for 45 minutes before I had to leave. I assumed the game auto-saved as there was no option to save and exit. I came back to find that my only option was to start a new game. Apparently there is NO SAVE FUNCTION. This just baffles the mind, how a game in the year 2017, that cannot be beaten in less than 20 minutes, doesn't have a save function. \n\n This game takes anywhere from 2-4 hours to play fully through according to most people, but that is just not feasible for SO many gamers. Not everyone can put life on hold for that long. I can't physically sit and game for more than an hour without pain in my back, and without a save function, this game is not worth your money. Until the dev adds a save function, this game is not worth it. I am refunding my copy, and after reading what the dev said in his thread about how he knows people want a save function, but he has been focusing on bugs so people can play the game, I doubt I will repurchase it if he does get around to adding the save feature. He seems to believe that it is not a necessary feature, and forcing players to play all the way through in one sitting is a perfectly acceptable requirement of players. It might just be me, but his attitude just irks me, but I may have read what he was saying incorrectly.

It's a single developer working on the game, and he seems to be doing what he can to get it in it's most playable state. He's read/heard the feedback, from what I can gather, and says that it will be something that's added. So, if not being able to save in such a short game is something that bothers you, just don't buy it. Don't leave a negative review based on something that the developer himself has said he will include when he can. \n\nNow onto the actual gameplay.\n\nThe game itself is pretty great to be honest. You essentially manage a group of gladiators, training them and doing arena (or pit) fights. There is also regional fights, which are basically boss battles (and sometimes quite tricky). First thing one would most likely want to do, is train \"Mind Control\" which although pretty self explainatory allows you to take direct control of one gladiator in the arena/pit fights. So don't be dismayed when the first arena fight you do, you are unable to control your character!\n\nThe fighting itself is pretty quick, there's a difficulty slider in options if you're having a tough time (or too easy of a time!) and although there isn't a huge array of weaponry, the armour upgrades are fantastic. One thing I would like to see, is a larger variety of weaponry added, though I'm sure that it will be eventually.\n\nOther than that, the small random events are quite interesting, and sometimes have great benefits, or lead to you being assassinated. Ya know, the usual. And the variety of NPCs you can hire in your camp are pretty neat, each providing different benefits.\n\nOverall I would say this game has absolutely fantastic potential, and for $10.99 (CAD) I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. And please to those who gave negative reviews solely based on the fact they cannot save, do consider rethinking it, as the developer (being one person) will more than likely struggle to get sales if the review score is \"Mostly Negative\" or \"Mixed\". People should do research and read the reviews yes, however to someone giving it a casual glance, it does the game quite the injustice.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30935658", "weighted_vote_score": "0.49253728985786438", "votes_up": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491279602, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491279472, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039661279", "playtime_forever": 2679, "last_played": 1521754869, "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Being one of the fortunate few who was given the opportunity to beta test Domina, I have loved this game ever since I laid my eyes on it, and even more since I was able to play it. I'll say this before I get in to my review of Domina. Every single bug that I've reported back to Bignic during the beta was fixed on the same day, the responsiveness and care that this man has for this game and game development as a whole speaks numbers about him as a developer and a person. I know for sure that I only look forward to even more releases if he decided to develop again after this.\n\nNow on to the review!\n\nDomina is a Roguelike/Roguelite (for those pedantic few out there) strategy game where the core focus is to build a ludus of strong gladiators to fight in the various arenas of rome for Fame, glory, gold and bloodshed. There are many different ways the game gives you to approach this, all of which would spoil the game for those of you looking to play this. I've always played this game on one of the harder difficulties, and I've always found the game challenging but never impossible. I've always felt in control of the outcome and take different approaches to change the result from the previous run; This is exactly how a roguelike game should be played.\n\nThe graphics in this game peferctly fit the atmosphere, they're a pixel madness of blood, gore and the soundtrack fits the setting to a tee. The game is bloody enough to be immersed in the atmosphere of the arena, but not messy enough so that you lose track of what's happening. \n\nOne of the main and most amazing ways I found that this game differentiates itself from many others is that you can play this game with absolutely no mechanics in hand, by allowing the AI that you have trained in many different specific ways to do the fighting for you. There is also an option to take over a gladiator in a fight, something I see almost all players do but more often than not I find myself allowing the AI to fight it out between them. It ads an element of uncertainty and surprise to the game that you just don't get with many others in this genre. \n\nDomina has been a wonderful experience all the way through, I find myself even after 30 hours played having fun on the game and thinking of ideas in my head for what kind of run I will embark on next, those of you who are fans of the genre will see the possibilities right away. For those of you who are new to roguelikes it may take you a little longer, but explore every element of the game, it's possibilities are vast. I reccomend this game fully! For $9.99 it's an absolute steal for the amount of enjoyment you will get from it and I seriously cannot reccomend it enough.\n\nI'll touch on this for one reason only, this game does not deserved a \"mixed\" rating whatsoever, and it frustrates me that reading through other reviews I see people displaying passion and love for what this game has brought to the table, praising all of it's features, through from it's mechanics to it's graphics and soundtrack; And then ending their review on a negative note because the game does not have something as simple as a save feature. Now understand this, I have never thought or suggested that the game needed a save feature, I've put a lot of time in to this and many many other roguelike games, I'm an avid fan of the genre. Roguelike games do not commonly possess save features, they're designed to be done and dusted in one run. Granted; Domina is a longer game so I do belive that your complaints are valid, I am not someone who agree's but I can understand the validity in it. What I will urge though is this; If you love a game, 100's of different features that the game has, but give it a thumbs down because it's missing one small feature, you shouldn't review games.\n\nThanks again to Bignic for making this wonderful and amazing game!", "comment_count": 2, "received_for_free": true, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30935632", "weighted_vote_score": "0.54766470193862915", "votes_up": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491279511, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491278017, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067696772", "playtime_forever": 698, "last_played": 1551461262, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "highly recommend it, its a hardcore roguelike game that has challenges in of its self and many different play style.

You try to restore glory to your house in 350 or so days, by winning 3 regional championships and the finaly tournament. You try to achieve this by buying and training slaves in the art of combat, kissing Legate's and Magistrate's ass, Hiring employees to improve your gladiators, and by sending the gladiators in their not so glorious death in the pit, and Glorious death in the arena.  Grab popcorn and watch AI gladiators to duke it out, or play as your champion it's up to you. It is basically Spartacus the videogame. Well Batiatus the videogame. \n\nThe biggest problem and boon with the game, it is completely carried by it's theme. Atleast for me. I cheer for my champions, I curse those who don't meet my expectations, and when the champions do die I cry out loud: \"Once again the gods spread the cheecks to ram co*** in ***** ***\". The blood is on the sand and crowd wants more of it! Sadly that is also the best part of the game in my honest opinion. I also have to commend the soundtrack. It is freaking excellent and it sets the mood perfectly.\n\nWhat is wrong with it?\n\nSaving or lack thereof. Game doesn't have a save feature which is crazy in this day and age. It doesn't matter how long your game is you have to have save feature in your game. I have hard time trying to find time to finish this game since I only have short bursts of time availeable for me in regards to gaming. I would love to play more Domina to the end content, but the two hourst required to play this game from start to finish is kind of a hard ask.  \n\nFiddly UI and hidden information. UI is designed tablet devices in mind I am sure of it. One of the main ways to give your gladiators boons are these \"Jupiter's cards\" and by Jupiter I do hate this system. It is pain in the ass to fiddle with these cards. Why do I have drag these cards around instead of clicking the gladiator I want them applied to? Why do I have to use \"recover cards\" car to recover already applied cards. Why can't I see what the cards do when they are on a gladiator? Why aren't the cards represented in a clean grid in the bottom of the screen? Why can't I see immieditely which gladiators already have cards? Why do I have to click specific spots on gladiators to upgrade equipment. Why can't I mass upgrade my gladiators' equipment?  Why can't I have a spreadsheet to see easily what classes my gladiators are, and what are their attributes and skills. You have to look at them one by one and it gets really annoying really fast. Why do I have to manually make everyone heal instead of having \"automatically heal if you have the money to do it\" - button like when I am training the gladiators? \n\nI am also afraid this game is soon \"figured out\" there are only so many optimal ways to go through the Doctore's tech tree.  I would have liked to see persistent AI luduses so I would have epic enemy champions that I should be afraid or rival, anything to make the world feel more alive. I have to admit that the Magistrate and Legate seem to have very little impact on the game other than \"Is your gladiator chained\" in the arena or not.

Most of the game time is spend in your Ludum, building and upgrading things. The things you upgrade and do otherwise are often just multipliers on damage and other such effects. \n\nYou guy gear for your gladiators to make them stronger in combat. This in turn feels like it has no effect to the fights, since they are often decided in under a second. In a group fight, all the gladiators start in two tight stacks. After the round starts, both stacks run into each other and hit once. The group that gets the first hits in, often wins, because those first hits hit EVERYONE SINGLE ONE of the other team's gladiators. \n\nTo counter this, you can control a single gladiator. This allows you to move around the battlefield and do the same moves as the terrible, terrible AI has available. In practice you'll quickly notice that the only way to win fights without losses, is to send in a single warrior with high agility. With that single soldier you kite all opponents until you've poked them all dead. Yet even with this cheesy tactic, you'll often get one-shot by a single gladiator, since attacks can deal all of your HP in one hit even if you have really good gear and good statistics.\n\nIn short, I find the game \"OK\" in terms of the management side, but your choices should have more impact on the gameplay. Also the (unnoticeable) effect of all the statistics and gear should be more verbosely explained for the player.

Imagine playing Sim City and then not being able to return to the city you've built before. Yes, that's the feeling. If that's the deciding factor for you - that game is definitely not for you and you probably will be disappointed.  \n\nHowever, If save feature gets implemented - there's no reason NOT to grab this. You could have read all of the save complaints in other negative reviews. Those are 100% true. I'll try to say why I think the game is good and might be worth your attention, even without the save.\n\n[h1]Video, if you'd rather watch[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnHClFHG5E8\n\n[h1]The Game[/h1]\nDomina is the game you\u2019re probably not going to complete. You can still enjoy it though. In Domina, you play as a wealthy woman who inherited her failing estate from the dying father. Having nothing to lose, she goes into \u201cgladiator fighting business\u201d. You have 365 days to prepare your gladiators for major tournament, all while training and participating in other fights (and also trying not to go broke).\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\u2022\tGladiator fights. With lots of gore.\n\u2022\tYou have a choice to control your gladiator directly or to watch how ai fights. Total chill. Exciting in both cases. Compare it to playing football or watching a match on tv. Both fun, but in different ways. Gladiator controls are smooth and responsive, but the hits / movement speed depend on how well-trained your gladiator is.\n\u2022\tA lot of gladiator management opportunities: you need to train gladiators, buy equipment, upgrade your villa, and appease government officials.\n\u2022\tEpic sounds and music\n\u2022\tNice pixel-art graphics that fit the violent atmosphere of the game perfectly.\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\u2022\tUhh. No save games. The game does not save progress on exit. It\u2019s a management game where you have to go through the year (2+ hours of gameplay) without being able to quit and return to this again later. \nEssentially, the game is a black box. You have the description of stats that you train, but there are 3 gladiator classes available. To add to that, each gladiator has 3 parameters (aggro / turtle / evasion \u2013 which give an idea what they mean, but no way to understand what works best when picking the class without lots of experimentation). In my eyes, it\u2019s not a con. If you want the game that leads you by hand \u2013 it\u2019s not one of those.\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nWell folks, there\u2019s no going around it: lack of save feature seriously takes away enjoyment from the game. Honestly, the lack of save-games is a huge let-down. I\u2019ve completed it once in a loss, took me 2 hours and I did not participate in any extra combats (pit fights) + did not spend much time going into gladiator stats in detail. I\u2019m not judging the developer, just saying my view from the third-person perspective: it\u2019s like he made a most precious jewel and then choose to drown it in dirt. Everything in the game is great, but the lack of save system spoils it. For a lot of people \u2013 that\u2019s a huge decisive factor and I understand.\nHaving that in mind, I cannot say that the game is bad. I really feel like the game does a top-notch job to simulating the gladiator fights. \u201cMixed\u201d reviews show the essence very well. To me, the game was fun to start every time (about 6-7 that I\u2019ve played, but I lost quite fast). The losing was pretty fun too: you just look how gladiators fight and then yours die off. If you want to complete the game and don\u2019t have 2+ free hours when you can concentrate \u2013 don\u2019t even think about it. If you just want to see cool gladiator combat \u2013 train your gladiators OR have extra time \u2013 A+, absolutely worth it. \n", "comment_count": 3, "received_for_free": true, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30928506", "weighted_vote_score": "0.543926358222961426", "votes_up": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1491244843, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491244754, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069605525", "playtime_forever": 391, "last_played": 1523336374, "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Great game, no save options.", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30928486", "weighted_vote_score": "0.493273526430130005", "votes_up": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1491244754, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491244732, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970729033", "playtime_forever": 66, "last_played": 1510947580, "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Really fun.

Fearing that citizens will re-establish the Republic, the Emperor decrees a year of epic gladiatorial games. Hoping to revive commerce, again establish the rule of law, and give the winner of the Great Championship unimaginable coin and glory.\n\nThis is where you come in as a heiress of a Ludas in the heart of the Roman countryside. Your father, who drove thr previous Ludas to the ground with poor decisions and lack of virtue, has given you ownership. With a new home and title of Ludista and Domina, you plan to participate while citizens are still interested in bloodshed. As local games are scheduled, you see an opportunity to participate during this interest of bloodshed. Hopefully that old woman is wrong and they will let you win.\n\nAs you and your gladiators progress and become more experienced, more will come in. The Doctore will show up to help you train your gladiators with upgrades, ranging from controlled breathing to throwing weapons. Next the Magistrate and Legate will barge in to provide their own services. The old Magistrate offering slaves and the Legate offering gladiators for sale; both having a satisfaction meter that can fluctuate with the different actions you take regarding them. Further in, 2 tables will appear, one for the Regional Championship games (4 needed to qualify) and the other for Jupiter's Blessings cards to attach to gladiators for boosts. Various random interactions will litter the playthough that can pit you against choosing between the Magistrate or Legate (or no one) or bring add how the outside world is.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around training and fighting gladiators, starting with 2 gladiators and a slave. Providing 3 classes they can be, 1 default and 2 locked behind upgrades, with their own weapons and armor style. Once you click them, it will bring various stats and tools used to balance out their training. Showing how their temperment/morale is due to various effects that will affect how they act, how much weight they have, a tool to balance training between various aspects such as agility or how smart the AI will play (Meditate), a character picture to upgrade or degrade armor, give them rewards, and kill, grand freedom, or sell them. \n\nWhile the Doctore is the main employee you will use, 9 others are available to fill up the 3 other spots. As the Architect has the only permanent upgrades, but will usually be employed the rest of the year, you must choose which one is best. With all bringing in their own speciality, one will make healing faster while the other may steal armor or spy to get secrets. \n\nRight by your 365 day deadline is how many days till a local battle, spreading out more towards the end of the year. You can organize pit fights (There is a bug where you can turn invisible though) and exhibition matches to gain favor between these times. Each will greet you with a screen showing information for who's hosting it (and their satisfaction with you), so you can pick your gladiator and choose to use AI or control it yourself with the Mind Control upgrade, reward and cost, the type, and your opponents. This can range from being against 1 gladiator to 2 gladiators and a lion. I do not know if your standing with the host effects anything, but my gladiator was only chained if it was bad. Be warned for backing out though, as the host will be upset with you even if your gladiators need more training.\n\nUpon acceptance, you will come into the arena with your opponents, all conditions will be done before it starts with the crowd cheering. If you have a high Meditate level your gladiator will fight with more confidence and easily handle the opponent, especially in a group; contrasting with a low level staying behind and not picking up on the opponent's cues. As your opponent will have the same things you have, don't think they will always be ill prepared. Winning will grant you buffs and rewards while losing will grant nothing or a consolation reward that can depend if the crowd was pleased with the amount of bloodshed. If you surrender, you will play a minigame to determine if the gladiator is killed, but it can be a really hard minigame as you can't click fast enough. The only way is clicking everything you can click. \n\nWhile I have avoided talking about the soundtrack, I do have to mention it here. It works well in showing that this is the world of gladiator fights. This is most prominent during the fights and certainly brings in the mood. During training it is calm but still brings in that you will have to fight sooner or later. Heads up though, it can be a little too loud when first opening up to the title screen.\n\nDomina has short to long runs depending on what you do and if you purposely throw the game away. With the replayability possibility high, everything is randomized including names, events, and stats of slaves/gladiators. So the game will call everyone by their title rather than their randomized name with the exception of the gladiators and slaves. \n\nAs most of the story is behind the tutorial, it allow the player to deal with pieces at a time when going past a certain action. Choosing not to go with the tutorial will give you everything immediently. While it can be possible to beat it in the tutorial mode, choosing not to will greatly increase your chances. I do recommend going over it at least once though so you can learn everything without having to rush it or be confused.\n\nWith the main drawing point is Domina being set in the Roman Empire when gladiators were popular, I did research some things int he game. It was interesting to see what could of influenced certain aspects of the game and showed it did take history into account.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n+ Brings in history\n+ The crowd in the arena\n+ The bloodshed of course!\n+ Random events, which can be hilarious\n+ Tutorial not meant to beat, but to give you piece by piece advice and story\n+ If you are a streamer, there is Twitch integration\n\n- No saving system. I do get why it is not implemented and runs do run short enough unless you live long enough to last for an hour or two. However, in a game like this it is important to have a saving feature of some kind as most people will not be able to stay on the computer for a long time. It could of easily worked in a way that Enter the Gungeon does it now where you can save and quit and once you go back in it is automatically deleted. Or an autosave feature where it saves after each battle. I know that this will turn people off till the developer decides to implement it. (Saving system has been added)\n- Invisible gladiators during pit fights. Remember to switch to AI if you have Mind Control once this is fixed!\n\nDomina is one of those games you need to learn how to play before you can appreciate it for what it is. It is a simple trainer down to it's core as you try to keep your gladiators shaped up compared to your opponents and happy but with a Roman twist. I was actually so attached to a specific gladiator that I couldn't bare to see them go. Which makes it harder to let them go if they request freedom. If you love strategy games, especially ones like these, I recommend picking this up. You would be surprised at what the ending brings. \n\nThough be sure you know there is no saving feature, and while this will not affect me recommending this game, it may affect whether or not you will buy it.\n\n[code]  [url=http://saveorquit.com/2017/04/07/review-domina/] Read the full review here![/url] [/code]", "comment_count": 0, "received_for_free": false, "voted_up": true, "recommendationid": "30923885", "weighted_vote_score": "0.561913728713989258", "votes_up": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "timestamp_updated": 1494403331, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_funny": 0}, {"timestamp_created": 1491227714, "language": "english", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007254277", "playtime_forever": 944, "last_played": 1521467745, "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0}, "review": "Easily one of the better indie games to come to steam.

I won't go much in depth with this review, but from the hour or so of gameplay, I really enjoy the game's style and music. There is some confusion about a lot of things in the game, like how good is a stat really at certain levels? Is it wise to focus on a few stats or always go with an all-around build with high meditation? Does sacrificing to the gods really do anything useful? and etc etc. Other than that, I really enjoy the game, thanks to the save feature I can now drop in and out as I see fit and actually enjoy the short bursts I play in.\nMusic is also really good.\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nThe game is pretty fun and all, but after I had to take a small break and closed down the game, I noticed theres no save feature. Checking through the steam forums it seems that the developers left that out because the game can be beaten in 2 hours max, or in a half hour if you are good I guess. \n\nSo unfortunately I cannot recommend the game cause no save feature is a real turn off for me who plays games for maybe half a hour then switch around.

This is cool, but the AI seems to be more efficient in using all of their moves available.\n\nIf your slaves die in battle, they're gone forever. If they succeed, they bring home a lot of money, resources, and train their stats up a bit. They sustain their damages after battles and need to be patched up. You can either do this by spending one coin and having them heal a small amount, or hiring a medic to speed up the process.\n\nOne of the choices you can make in the game is who to hire. There are loads of people to choose from, but you can only have a certain amount, and they take up resources everyday. One possible employee can upgrade your Ludum (The place you are training your slaves). Another keeps your people healed, while another can help you save a bit of food. It's all choice, which is great!\n\nSo after you complete a battle, you have a set amount of time to do everything else you want until the next one begins. This includes purchasing resources, training slaves, healing slaves etc. Personally, I feel like the game could have done without this, because once you click on something to open up a menu, the timer pauses. So all you're really doing is rushing to find what you want to click next, and then once you've clicked it you've got all the time in the world to make your selection and think about what you want to click next. I understand that they probably did it to only allow you to train a certain amount per day, but it can still be a bit frustrating at times.\n\nYou do however, have the choice to reject fights that are offered to you. In doing so, you will anger the host of the fight. There are 2 people that organize fights for you, and they chill at your Ludus all day. If you get on their good side, they will offer fights that are more beneficial towards you. If you piss them off, they will give you really unfair fights that your guys are bound to lose at.\n\nTo win these 2 over, you can bribe them with wine, or giving them secrets about the other host, etc. It's a pretty interesting aspect of the game.\n\nThe big picture is that you want to win the grand tournament. In order to do that, you need to travel the country winning some really hard fights. REALLY hard. So in order to succeed, you must train your guys for quite a while, while keeping an eye on your resources.\n\nFighting is quite fun to watch actually. You feel like you're a part of the crowd. It can get really intense sometimes because your best gladiator is on the line. If you throw a slave in without any weapons or shields, sometimes the crowds will toss things for them into the arena, but the slave needs to avoid the other gladiator to get it. I've seen a completely unarmed slave beat a shielded gladiator once. It was a really awesome feeling. I actually just threw that slave in there because I didn't want him anymore, but he came out victorious.\n\nThere is a story. Although it's nothing amazing, and easily skippable, I'm sure some people will get a kick out of reading the text boxes that lay the tale down. There are ocasional pop-ups throughout the game, kind of in the style of FTL, where you will be given a situation and you can choose how to deal with it. Depending on your choice, you might earn a new Gladiator, earn the trust of one of the 2 hosts or nothing at all. It adds an extra layer of Rogue-lite-ness.\n\nLastly, the soundtrack kicks so much ass. It's a really unique listen, and the game is programmed to have the music kick in as soon as a battle starts, and it just feels so awesome.\n\nOne pretty major flaw, is that at the moment of writing this there doesn't seem to be a save feature. If you feel like you're done for the day, your run is over for good. You can't come back to it. And your runs can be relatively long, so it would be a welcome addition.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun, and very well polished game. I think people who enjoy the randomness of Rogue-likes/lites will get a kick out of this.
